More details on the TATTO program can be found in the LGS Handbook.  \nCSI PhD students must fulfill their minimal teaching requirements by completing three TATT 605 courses, i.e. serving as a TA for three courses. Alternatively, each TATT 610 instructorship can replace two TATT 605s. (A student may also serve as a TA or Instructor for additional courses after satisfying the minimal requirements.) Each graduate instructor will have a faculty mentor for the course that they are teaching or co-teaching.  \nNote: All TATT courses (600, 605, 610) are an integral part of PhD students' academic curriculum. As such, they are graded on a pass/fail basis, and students can receive a \"U\" (Unsatisfactory) grade in TATT if expected standards of diligence and contribution to the educational mission are not met.  \nCS 590 Teaching Seminar explores theoretical and practical approaches for effective teaching, with particular emphasis on the discipline of Computer Science. After this course, students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of multiple pedagogical strategies, write a syllabus, develop assessment items, and design and deliver lectures and presentations for a variety of different audiences.  \nNote: All departing graduate students must provide copies of their grade books (or spreadsheets) for the courses they taught in the preceding year. If you teach during the academic year, you must send an electronic grade book to the Program Administrator before the department will sign off on your degree application.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

If the sponsor does not allow stipend support during this timeframe, LGS Finance will work with the faculty and the program to ensure funding is available at Emory.  \nDuring these eight weeks, students are expected to maintain registration, remain in contact with their advisor, and engage in minimal academic activity (e.g., reading), as agreed upon by the student and their advisor, assuming the student's and child's good health.

Students who fail to maintain continuous enrollment must submit an online form and apply for readmission at least 30 days before the term they wish to re-register.  \nThe first step in applying for readmission is contacting the program's DGS. Next, the student must submit a readmission form on the LGS website. Finally, the student's program will be asked to approve the readmission application. Readmission is approved at the discretion of the program or division, which may also prescribe additional course requirements.  \nConsideration for readmission includes a student's academic standing and review of their pre-approved plan for return that outlines timely academic progress at the end of the last term registered, including any incomplete grades converted to an F or U during the student's absence. Students who have exceeded the nine-year enrollment limit on the time to degree cannot be readmitted.  \nStudents with enrollment holds must contact Emory's Office of Student Accounts and Billing or other appropriate office and apply for readmission once the hold has been removed.  \nStudents who decide not to continue their graduate study in a doctoral program and switch to a  \nterminal master's degree may be readmitted into the doctoral program from which they intend to earn their terminal master's degree.",

In some cases, LGS provides full support (tuition, stipend, health insurance) for the first 21 months (i.e., Fall of year one thru spring of year two including the intervening summer). In those cases, after 21 months, PhD students are expected to join a research group and go on faculty grant support, i.e. receive a stipend through an RA or another form of external support. In exceptional circumstances, alternative arrangements may be possible on case-by-case basis, based on performance evaluation and good progress in the program. Full time PhD students may alternatively be supported by a faculty research assistantship (RA) from the date of matriculation (\"Day1 funding\") rather than Laney GSF for 21 months followed by an RAship.  \nNote: All PhD students irrespective of their funding source (e.g. initial Laney GSF, Day1, self-funded) are required to complete the exact same requirements including TATTO and research rotations."

A student must request approval for a change to a terminal master's degree status, the term in which the student seeks to receive the terminal master's. This request for approval must be submitted before the degree application deadline for the relevant term.  \nIf completion of the terminal master's degree extends beyond the term approved for the master's degree, the student may receive a tuition scholarship but will not receive a stipend or student health insurance.

All students who receive financial aid from federal, state, or Emory-funded sources must be enrolled degree candidates in good standing to retain financial aid awards. Academic records will be evaluated each term. Evaluation factors include:  \n- Grade point average (GPA),\n- Time to degree completion, and\n- Percentage of courses passed.  \nStudents must also meet the following minimum grade requirements to meet satisfactory academic progress standards.  \n- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS, MSM): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.\n- Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.  \nAny student who fails for two successive terms to pass two-thirds of the hours taken shall be automatically excluded regardless of any previous average.  \nAll students are expected to complete their degree programs within a maximum time frame.

This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

Therefore, the Office of Financial Aid must monitor a student aid recipient's academic progress. Aid recipients must meet specific quantitative and qualitative measures and complete their programs within a maximum time. All students who receive financial aid from federal, state, or Emory-funded sources must be enrolled degree candidates in good standing to retain financial aid awards. Academic records will be evaluated each term. Evaluation factors include:  \n- Grade point average (GPA),\n- Time to degree completion, and\n- Percentage of courses passed.  \nStudents must also meet the following minimum grade requirements to meet satisfactory academic progress standards.  \n- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS, MSM): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.\n- Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.  \nAny student who fails for two successive terms to pass two-thirds of the hours taken shall be automatically excluded regardless of any previous average.  \nAll students are expected to complete their degree programs within a maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for graduate students is 150% of the hours required to complete their degree program. Time to degree completion is calculated for all credit hours for which the student enrolls or receives credit at Emory. The following grades are assigned: A, B, C, D, F, Satisfactory, and Unsatisfactory. A course assigned an Incomplete, in progress, or Withdrawal is counted toward attempted credits. Audited classes are not considered attempted credits.  \n- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS): Must complete the degree within 108 attempted units based on a 72-unit degree requirement.

This assessment shall include a determination of the nature, duration, and severity of the risk posed by the student to the health or safety of themself or others, the probability that the  \npotentially threatening injury will occur, and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will sufficiently mitigate the risk. With appropriate authorization, the professional will share their recommendation with the Assistant or Associate Dean, who will consider this recommendation in determining whether the student should be involuntarily withdrawn from Emory. A copy of the professional's recommendation will be provided to the student unless, in the opinion of a mental health professional, it would be damaging to the student.  \nIf the evaluation results in a determination by the mental health professional that the student's continued attendance presents no significant risk to the health or safety of the student or others and no considerable threat to the property, to the lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University, no further action shall be taken to withdraw the student from the University.  \nIf the evaluation results in a determination that the continued attendance of the student presents a significant risk to the health or safety of the student or others, such that there is a high probability of substantial harm or a significant threat to the property, the lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University, the student may be involuntarily withdrawn from the University. In such an event, the student shall be informed in writing by the Assistant or Associate Dean of the involuntary withdrawal of the student's right to an informal hearing, their right to appeal the hearing officer's decision, and any conditions necessary for re-enrollment. In most cases, a student who is involuntarily withdrawn will be given a grade of W in all courses in which the student is currently enrolled."

Students register for TATT 605 during the semester of a TAship or TATT 610 during a semester as instructor of record for a course. In exceptional circumstances where a student cannot complete TATT 600 before serving as a TA, they are still required to take TATT 600 after fulfilling their teaching responsibilities. More details on the TATTO program can be found in the LGS Handbook.  \nCSI PhD students must fulfill their minimal teaching requirements by completing three TATT 605 courses, i.e. serving as a TA for three courses. Alternatively, each TATT 610 instructorship can replace two TATT 605s. (A student may also serve as a TA or Instructor for additional courses after satisfying the minimal requirements.) Each graduate instructor will have a faculty mentor for the course that they are teaching or co-teaching.  \nNote: All TATT courses (600, 605, 610) are an integral part of PhD students' academic curriculum. As such, they are graded on a pass/fail basis, and students can receive a \"U\" (Unsatisfactory) grade in TATT if expected standards of diligence and contribution to the educational mission are not met.  \nCS 590 Teaching Seminar explores theoretical and practical approaches for effective teaching, with particular emphasis on the discipline of Computer Science. After this course, students will be able to demonstrate knowledge of multiple pedagogical strategies, write a syllabus, develop assessment items, and design and deliver lectures and presentations for a variety of different audiences.  \nNote: All departing graduate students must provide copies of their grade books (or spreadsheets) for the courses they taught in the preceding year. If you teach during the academic year, you must send an electronic grade book to the Program Administrator before the department will sign off on your degree application. If there is an outstanding or incomplete grade in a class you taught, or in your grade book, you must also leave a statement to the program coordinator stating what is left for the student to complete to change the grade.",

In addition, TATTO prepares our students to apply this\nknowledge in various professional settings inside and outside the academy.  \nThe titles TA and teaching associate designate a student's progress through the TATTO program. TA  \nexperience varies from program to program. The defining characteristic of this opportunity across all programs is a mentored initial teaching experience. A TA may be responsible for 10 to 12 hours per week of discussion, laboratory supervision, etc. The Teaching Associate experience advances the student to a teaching opportunity with more significant learning experiences, sometimes in a co-teaching arrangement with a faculty member. In some programs, the student and faculty collaborate on all aspects of a course, from syllabus design to final grading. In other programs, a teaching associate could learn from teaching an entire class with ongoing mentoring.  \nIn compliance with recommendations of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, students may only be the instructor of record for a course after they have completed at least 18 hours of graduate credit in their teaching field.  \nA student may only be a TA or teaching associate for up to five terms during their first five years at Emory with the approval of the Assistant Dean of Professional Development and Career Planning.

Therefore, the Office of Financial Aid must monitor a student aid recipient's academic progress. Aid recipients must meet specific quantitative and qualitative measures and complete their programs within a maximum time. All students who receive financial aid from federal, state, or Emory-funded sources must be enrolled degree candidates in good standing to retain financial aid awards. Academic records will be evaluated each term. Evaluation factors include:  \n- Grade point average (GPA),\n- Time to degree completion, and\n- Percentage of courses passed.  \nStudents must also meet the following minimum grade requirements to meet satisfactory academic progress standards.  \n- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS, MSM): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.\n- Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.  \nAny student who fails for two successive terms to pass two-thirds of the hours taken shall be automatically excluded regardless of any previous average.  \nAll students are expected to complete their degree programs within a maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for graduate students is 150% of the hours required to complete their degree program. Time to degree completion is calculated for all credit hours for which the student enrolls or receives credit at Emory. The following grades are assigned: A, B, C, D, F, Satisfactory, and Unsatisfactory. A course assigned an Incomplete, in progress, or Withdrawal is counted toward attempted credits. Audited classes are not considered attempted credits.  \n- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS): Must complete the degree within 108 attempted units based on a 72-unit degree requirement.

It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance.

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships.

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.",

Students who still disagree with the instructor should address their concerns to the graduate studies or PD, who will seek to resolve the matter with the instructor and the student. Consistent with principles of academic freedom, responsibility for evaluating a student's course performance rests with the instructor.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships.

It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships.

It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature from the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5 b0c965c987b3c9053079b3 shall apply to allegations of harassment by a student based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age,  \ndisability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community.

Students assume individual responsibility for\ntheir conduct and their violations of the requirements of the Student Conduct Code. Continuation as a\nstudent is conditional upon compliance with these requirements. This Code does not purport to\ncatalog every action that would be considered unacceptable behavior and, thus, a violation of the\nConduct Code. Instead, it attempts to exemplify conduct that would almost certainly consider a\nviolation. Further, this Code describes in detail the operation of the conduct procedures within the\nLGS. LGS school administration may act outside the protocols listed herein in order to take necessary,\nprotective action to ensure that members of the Emory community are not subject to imminent harm.",
            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration.

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.",
            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

Each student is responsible for understanding this statement, conducting their research, and writing following the highest standards of integrity.  \nA writer's data, facts, ideas, and phraseology should be regarded as their property. Any person who uses a writer's data, facts, ideas, or phraseology without giving due credit is guilty of plagiarism. Information may be put into a research paper, thesis, or dissertation without a footnote or other documentation only if it meets all the following conditions:  \n1. It may be found in several books on the subject.\n2. It is written entirely in the student's words.\n3. It is not paraphrased from any source and is regarded as common knowledge.  \nWhenever any idea is taken from a specific work, even when the student writes it entirely in their own words, there must be a citation giving credit to the author responsible for it. Methods of citation vary. The student must provide appropriate credit.  \nThe student is entirely responsible for knowing and following the principles of paraphrasing:  \n*In paraphrasing, you express another writer's ideas in your own words. A good paraphrase preserves the sense of the original but not the form. It does not retain the sentence patterns and merely substitutes synonyms for the actual words, nor does it retain the original words and merely alter the sentence patterns. It is a genuine restatement. Invariably it should be briefer than the source. (Floyd C. Watkins, William B. Dillingham, and Edward T. Martin, Practical English Handbook, 3rd ed., Boston, 1970, p. 245.)*  \nAny direct quotation must be documented. Even when a student uses only one unusual keyword from a passage, that word should be quoted. If a common brief phrase is used as it occurs in a source, the words should be in quotation marks. Any questions should be referred to the DGS or the PD in the student's program.  \nThe LGS and the Undergraduate Academic Honor Code of Emory College Of Arts And Sciences, Goizueta Business School, And Oxford College concur that using an artificial intelligence program to generate any content for any assignment (including, but not limited to, examinations, papers, homework, and creative work) constitutes plagiarism and is a violation of the Honor Code unless students acknowledge in the assignment the extent to which an artificial intelligence program contributed to their work and outside resources are permitted for the assignment. Using an artificial intelligence program for an academic  \nassignment when external resources are not allowed or when the use of artificial intelligence programs is prohibited may also constitute seeking unauthorized assistance or violate other provisions of the Honor Code.

It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop.

Students assume individual responsibility for\ntheir conduct and their violations of the requirements of the Student Conduct Code. Continuation as a\nstudent is conditional upon compliance with these requirements. This Code does not purport to\ncatalog every action that would be considered unacceptable behavior and, thus, a violation of the\nConduct Code. Instead, it attempts to exemplify conduct that would almost certainly consider a\nviolation. Further, this Code describes in detail the operation of the conduct procedures within the\nLGS. LGS school administration may act outside the protocols listed herein in order to take necessary,\nprotective action to ensure that members of the Emory community are not subject to imminent harm.",

Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop.

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature from the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5 b0c965c987b3c9053079b3 shall apply to allegations of harassment by a student based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age,  \ndisability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration.

Therefore, when a student engages in behavior that could constitute a violation of Emory's rules of conduct, the behavior will be addressed as a disciplinary matter under the applicable Student Conduct Code or, as appropriate, Honor Code, which defines prohibited conduct and outlines a process for conducting disciplinary proceedings.  \nThis Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure is not a disciplinary code, policy, or process. It is not intended to apply to situations in which a student engages in behavior that could violate the University's rules of conduct (e.g., an Honor Code or Conduct Code). It is intended to apply when a student's observed behavior, actions, or statements indicate a direct threat to the student's health, safety or an immediate threat to the health or safety of others. There may be situations where this Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and the Student Conduct Code may apply. In all cases, the Dean of the LGS shall have final authority regarding the decision, enactment, enforcement, and management of the involuntary withdrawal of a student.",

Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that poses a high probability of substantial harm to themselves or others; or  \n2. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that would cause significant property damage would directly and substantially impede the lawful activities of others or interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University.",

Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that poses a high probability of substantial harm to themself or others; or  \n2. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that would cause significant property damage would directly and substantially impede the lawful activities of others or interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University.  \nWithdrawals in such cases shall normally incur no academic penalty for the term the student is enrolled, and a tuition refund, if any, shall be based on the schedule established for voluntary withdrawal. Because the involuntary withdrawal policy applies to cases where there is a concern about the safety of the student or others, the Dean or their designee may require a student involuntarily withdrawn under this policy to be re-evaluated before they are readmitted.",
            "# Section 3: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Evaluation  \nThe Assistant or Associate Dean may refer the student for a mandatory evaluation by an appropriate mental health professional. The University may select a mental health professional so long as there is no cost to the student for the evaluation. A written copy of the involuntary referral shall be provided to the student.  \nThe evaluation must be completed within five (5) school days after the referral letter is provided to the student. Before the evaluation, the student must sign a written authorization to exchange relevant information between the mental health professional(s) and the University. Upon completion, copies of the evaluation report will be provided to the Assistant or Associate Dean and the student.  \nThe identified professional making the evaluation shall make an individualized and objective assessment of the student's ability to safely participate in Emory's program based on a reasonable professional judgment relying on the most current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence. This assessment shall include a determination of the nature, duration, and severity of the risk posed by the student to the health or safety of themself or others, the probability that the  \npotentially threatening injury will occur, and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will sufficiently mitigate the risk. With appropriate authorization, the professional will share their recommendation with the Assistant or Associate Dean, who will consider this recommendation in determining whether the student should be involuntarily withdrawn from Emory. A copy of the professional's recommendation will be provided to the student unless, in the opinion of a mental health professional, it would be damaging to the student.  \nIf the evaluation results in a determination by the mental health professional that the student's continued attendance presents no significant risk to the health or safety of the student or others and no considerable threat to the property, to the lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University, no further action shall be taken to withdraw the student from the University.  \nIf the evaluation results in a determination that the continued attendance of the student presents a significant risk to the health or safety of the student or others, such that there is a high probability of substantial harm or a significant threat to the property, the lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University, the student may be involuntarily withdrawn from the University. In such an event, the student shall be informed in writing by the Assistant or Associate Dean of the involuntary withdrawal of the student's right to an informal hearing, their right to appeal the hearing officer's decision, and any conditions necessary for re-enrollment.

A hearing will be set as soon as reasonably possible. The student shall remain involuntarily withdrawn pending completion of the hearing.  \nThe hearing shall be informal and non-adversarial. During the hearing, the student may present relevant information and be advised by an Emory faculty, staff member, or licensed health professional.

Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.",
            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html"

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html"

A formal appeal must be made in writing to the Senior Associate Dean within seven (7) days of receiving the record.  \nMere dissatisfaction with the decision of the Dean is not grounds for appeal. A student may only appeal on the following grounds:  \n- Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;\n- New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the grievance was resolved which could have affected the outcome; and\n- Members of the Committee on Grievances had a conflict of interest or demonstrated bias for or against the accused student that affected the outcome of the matter.  \nThe Executive Council will review the appeal and may review all records in the case to determine if there is a reasonable basis for changing the outcome. The Executive Council will issue a written determination of the appeal and provide a rationale for its decision. The Executive Council may reach one of the following decisions.  \n- Dismiss the appeal for (1) failure to state a procedural irregularity, (2) failure to present new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the grievance was resolved, which could have affected the outcome, or (3) failure to state a conflict of interest or a demonstrated bias against the student on the part of a member of the Committee on Grievances.\n- Affirm the Dean's decision.\n- Overturn the Dean's decision and issue a new decision. The Executive Council may come to a new finding about the validity of the grievance. It may also issue a new remedy if necessary.\n- Remand the case back to the Committee on Grievances or to a new Committee on Grievances to correct a procedural or factual defect.  \nThe Executive Council's determinations are final and not appealable; however, the outcome of a remanded case may again be appealed.  \nThe Senior Associate Dean shall promptly notify the student and LGS Dean in writing of the Executive Council's decision.  \nUse of the LGS grievance procedure will not prejudice in any way a student's rights under Emory University Policy 10.12, which pertains to Student Complaints, and provides that \"[s]students should  \nfirst attempt to resolve their complaints with the office most directly responsible for the action being challenged.\"",

In the event of dismissal, international students must notify International Student and Scholar Services.  \nStudents recommended for academic dismissal by their academic program will receive a letter from their program informing them of the reasons for the recommendation for dismissal. Students will have five business days from the date of the program dismissal letter to inform their DGS and the LGS Student Affairs Dean of their intent to appeal the recommendation for dismissal. Students must begin and follow their program handbook appeal process within five business days of notifying their DGS and LGS Student Affairs Dean of their intent to appeal actions leading to the recommendation of the dismissal. Students are also strongly encouraged to meet with the LGS Student Affairs Dean to review the process and have their questions answered.  \nIn most cases, programs will respond to the appeal in writing within 30 days of receipt of the complaint. However, exceptions to this timeframe may be allowed with reasonable and regular communication to inform the student of the complaint's status. Programs must inform the LGS Student Affairs Dean in writing of the outcome of the appeal before the end of the term in which the case is being reviewed. If the matter cannot be resolved within the program, or the student disagrees with the resolution, the student may submit a complaint to the LGS Committee on Grievances.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",
            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.",

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature from the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5 b0c965c987b3c9053079b3 shall apply to allegations of harassment by a student based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age,  \ndisability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days."

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration.

        "retrieved_docs": [
            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships.

            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature from the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5 b0c965c987b3c9053079b3 shall apply to allegations of harassment by a student based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age,  \ndisability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration.

In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.",

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html",

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.  \nEqual Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nSexual Misconduct Policy (Title IX):\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b  \nAlcohol and Drug Abuse Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19654/?security=413e09c3fee6a98f74d0b5aabd5220b74d932e48  \nInformation Technology Conditions of Use: https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17569  \nPolicy on Authorship Guidelines and Dispute Resolution:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17540?security=c5fe9c92049de33a4186c9f0f335e828a88fd662  \nGuidelines for Responsible Conduct of Scholarship and Research:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17546?security=5100e4db1e477ed38aae83924c0c7ae409ef42af  \nConfidentiality and Release of Information about Students:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17620/?security=13d9b9006bbe82583abd111fe01341432f80643a  \nRespect for Open Expression Policy:\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/19648?security=c6f36f9de43a2cd25fc99614d09384f649a313cf  \nStudent Complaints\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/17609?security=481f3bc9642d299f207fa5ff46cdff6244ddea66  \nEmory Trust Line\nhttp://compliance.emory.edu/about/trust-line/index.html"

            "# 3.4 Computer Science and Informatics Ph.D. Program: Rotation Requirements (CS 598R)  \nRotation projects provide practicum opportunities to students prior to their dissertation research. The objective is to expose students to computational research problems in practical settings and to potential faculty research advisors, collaborators and thesis committee members. Rotations may also help to provide focus on a specific research area and to jump-start dissertation projects. PhD students must complete two rotation projects as part of the candidacy qualifying process; the first rotation should be completed before the start of Year 2 and the second rotation before the start of Year 3.  \nA rotation project is a three-credit hour, semester long activity with pre-defined deliverables and a final evaluation. Students register for CS598R for each rotation project under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Students will be helped by their thesis advisor (or appropriate DGS/co-DGS, if they don't have an advisor) when choosing a rotation faculty advisor. If the advisor is not a member of the CSI program faculty, then DGS approval and a co-advisor from the program are required.  \nStudents must submit a project proposal with well-defined outcomes and deliverables prior to starting a rotation project and submit a final report upon completion. An accepted or published paper may serve as the final report. If software development is involved in the project, it is important to clearly specify the deliverable at the start of the project. Students must also present their work at a department seminar.  \nFor CSI Main Track Students with interdisciplinary research interests in biomedical or public health informatics, rotation projects may involve participation in research laboratories in Biology, Chemistry, Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, or external organizations such as the CDC. BMI Students are recommended to select a domain-focused rotation faculty mentor, in addition to their advisor, who will provide the biomedical, clinical or translational domain use cases that will drive their informatics training.\nA student may earn 3 hours of course credit for each rotation project through CS598R. A single multi-semester project may continue as CS599R (not another CS598R).",
            "# 3.2 Computer Science and Informatics Ph.D. Program: Teaching Requirements  \nTeaching training is an important part of a student's overall preparation for possible academic careers. Students are expected to complete their teaching requirements during their first two years (Fall, Spring, Summer of Year 1, and Fall and Spring of Year 2).  \nStudents must complete summer TATTO (TATT 600) course offered through LGS prior to serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Instructor. Students register for TATT 605 during the semester of a TAship or TATT 610 during a semester as instructor of record for a course. In exceptional circumstances where a student cannot complete TATT 600 before serving as a TA, they are still required to take TATT 600 after fulfilling their teaching responsibilities. More details on the TATTO program can be found in the LGS Handbook.  \nCSI PhD students must fulfill their minimal teaching requirements by completing three TATT 605 courses, i.e. serving as a TA for three courses.

Rotations may also help to provide focus on a specific research area and to jump-start dissertation projects. PhD students must complete two rotation projects as part of the candidacy qualifying process; the first rotation should be completed before the start of Year 2 and the second rotation before the start of Year 3.  \nA rotation project is a three-credit hour, semester long activity with pre-defined deliverables and a final evaluation. Students register for CS598R for each rotation project under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Students will be helped by their thesis advisor (or appropriate DGS/co-DGS, if they don't have an advisor) when choosing a rotation faculty advisor. If the advisor is not a member of the CSI program faculty, then DGS approval and a co-advisor from the program are required.  \nStudents must submit a project proposal with well-defined outcomes and deliverables prior to starting a rotation project and submit a final report upon completion. An accepted or published paper may serve as the final report. If software development is involved in the project, it is important to clearly specify the deliverable at the start of the project. Students must also present their work at a department seminar.  \nFor CSI Main Track Students with interdisciplinary research interests in biomedical or public health informatics, rotation projects may involve participation in research laboratories in Biology, Chemistry, Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, or external organizations such as the CDC. BMI Students are recommended to select a domain-focused rotation faculty mentor, in addition to their advisor, who will provide the biomedical, clinical or translational domain use cases that will drive their informatics training.\nA student may earn 3 hours of course credit for each rotation project through CS598R.

If the advisor is not a member of the CSI program faculty, then DGS approval and a co-advisor from the program are required.  \nStudents must submit a project proposal with well-defined outcomes and deliverables prior to starting a rotation project and submit a final report upon completion. An accepted or published paper may serve as the final report. If software development is involved in the project, it is important to clearly specify the deliverable at the start of the project. Students must also present their work at a department seminar.  \nFor CSI Main Track Students with interdisciplinary research interests in biomedical or public health informatics, rotation projects may involve participation in research laboratories in Biology, Chemistry, Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, or external organizations such as the CDC. BMI Students are recommended to select a domain-focused rotation faculty mentor, in addition to their advisor, who will provide the biomedical, clinical or translational domain use cases that will drive their informatics training.\nA student may earn 3 hours of course credit for each rotation project through CS598R. A single multi-semester project may continue as CS599R (not another CS598R)."

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved.

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved.

Full time PhD students may alternatively be supported by a faculty research assistantship (RA) from the date of matriculation (\"Day1 funding\") rather than Laney GSF for 21 months followed by an RAship.  \nNote: All PhD students irrespective of their funding source (e.g. initial Laney GSF, Day1, self-funded) are required to complete the exact same requirements including TATTO and research rotations.",
            "# Section 9.3: Parental Arrangements: Stipend Support  \nEligible students receiving stipend support should continue to receive it throughout the arrangements. NIH allows grant funds to be used for this purpose, provided it follows our institutional policy. Many other federal agencies have their policies regarding parental arrangements. If the sponsor does not allow stipend support during this timeframe, LGS Finance will work with the faculty and the program to ensure funding is available at Emory.  \nDuring these eight weeks, students are expected to maintain registration, remain in contact with their advisor, and engage in minimal academic activity (e.g., reading), as agreed upon by the student and their advisor, assuming the student's and child's good health. After eight weeks, students resume their responsibilities, and if students need additional arrangements, they should speak with their DGS and the LGS Student Affairs Dean.",

            "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships.

Therefore, when a student engages in behavior that could constitute a violation of Emory's rules of conduct, the behavior will be addressed as a disciplinary matter under the applicable Student Conduct Code or, as appropriate, Honor Code, which defines prohibited conduct and outlines a process for conducting disciplinary proceedings.  \nThis Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure is not a disciplinary code, policy, or process. It is not intended to apply to situations in which a student engages in behavior that could violate the University's rules of conduct (e.g., an Honor Code or Conduct Code). It is intended to apply when a student's observed behavior, actions, or statements indicate a direct threat to the student's health, safety or an immediate threat to the health or safety of others. There may be situations where this Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and the Student Conduct Code may apply. In all cases, the Dean of the LGS shall have final authority regarding the decision, enactment, enforcement, and management of the involuntary withdrawal of a student.",
            "# Article III: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance  \nPreamble  \nLGS grants rights to the students in its community that align with the LGS vision and mission. These rights include:  \n1. The right to academic freedom includes freedom of thought and expression per Emory's Respect for Open Expression Policy 8.14.\n2. The right to be free from discrimination, bias, and harassment based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, ability status, genetic information, veteran status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law.\n3. The right to fair and due process procedures in LGS Honor, Conduct, and Grievance cases.\n4. The right to participate in academic and non-academic activities sponsored by the University within the constraints of applicable policies or requirements.  \nAll students, faculty, and members of the Emory community are also expected to cooperate in maintaining academic and conduct integrity. Members of the Emory community should strive to excel in their academic pursuits in a just way with honesty and fairness in mind and avoid all instances of cheating, lying, plagiarizing, or engaging in other acts that violate these Honor and Conduct Codes.  \nLGS expects every student and member of our Emory community to know the policies provided and cited herein. Therefore, all students should revisit the Handbook and any linked policies as frequently as needed to familiarize themselves or check for updates to these policies.",

Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that poses a high probability of substantial harm to themself or others; or  \n2. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that would cause significant property damage would directly and substantially impede the lawful activities of others or interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University.  \nWithdrawals in such cases shall normally incur no academic penalty for the term the student is enrolled, and a tuition refund, if any, shall be based on the schedule established for voluntary withdrawal. Because the involuntary withdrawal policy applies to cases where there is a concern about the safety of the student or others, the Dean or their designee may require a student involuntarily withdrawn under this policy to be re-evaluated before they are readmitted.",
            "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:  \na. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature from the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5 b0c965c987b3c9053079b3 shall apply to allegations of harassment by a student based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age,  \ndisability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.\nhttps://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5b0c965c987b3c9053079b3  \nc. Sexual harassment and other Prohibited Conduct outlined in the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination:https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b LGS prohibits all conduct that violates the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy, and allegations of such behavior will be addressed under that policy.  \n8) Recording without Consent: Taking a photograph or making an image or audio or video recording, including \"streaming\" audio or video, of any member of the Emory community without that person's consent. Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.",
            "# Section 7.3: Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence: Leaves of Absence  \nA student may be granted two one-year leave (no more than six terms) of absence upon recommendation of the student's program and approval of the Dean. Leaves of absence (LOA) are available to students only within five years of admission. The student must demonstrate that during this period, they must interrupt progress toward the degree. The student should be aware that the University will not certify to loan officers or government agencies that a student on an LOA is enrolled in or actively pursuing a course of study. International students must discuss their LOA plans with International Student and Scholar Services to determine how the LOA will impact their visa status. If the student is a veteran, they must contact the Office of the Registrar at registr@emory.edu.  \nIn most cases, a student must be in good standing and have no incomplete assignments to be eligible for an LOA. In addition, time spent on an LOA does not count toward the nine-year limit for the doctoral degree or the five-year limit for the terminal master's degree. Students beyond these limits are not eligible for leave but may apply for an extension of the time allowed to complete degree requirements per the rules governing such extension.  \nAn LOA is not used to resolve academic difficulties or finish incomplete assignments. Instead, this policy is intended to allow students to leave academic life for a specified period. During which they do not progress toward the degree. Examples of an LOA include:  \n- a unique professional or educational circumstance,\n- short-term disabilities, or\n- competing responsibilities that preclude meaningful progress toward the degree.  \nCircumstances pertaining to pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare should first be considered through our Parental Arrangement policy but may also be addressed through the LOA policy. Students should develop a written plan and timeline for their leave and return and consult their DGS, Faculty Mentor, and the LGS Student Affairs office before submitting a request for an LOA.  \nA student returning to the LGS after an LOA should request readmission at least 30 days before the beginning of the term they wish to return."

            "# 3.4 Computer Science and Informatics Ph.D. Program: Rotation Requirements (CS 598R)  \nRotation projects provide practicum opportunities to students prior to their dissertation research. The objective is to expose students to computational research problems in practical settings and to potential faculty research advisors, collaborators and thesis committee members. Rotations may also help to provide focus on a specific research area and to jump-start dissertation projects. PhD students must complete two rotation projects as part of the candidacy qualifying process; the first rotation should be completed before the start of Year 2 and the second rotation before the start of Year 3.  \nA rotation project is a three-credit hour, semester long activity with pre-defined deliverables and a final evaluation. Students register for CS598R for each rotation project under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Students will be helped by their thesis advisor (or appropriate DGS/co-DGS, if they don't have an advisor) when choosing a rotation faculty advisor. If the advisor is not a member of the CSI program faculty, then DGS approval and a co-advisor from the program are required.  \nStudents must submit a project proposal with well-defined outcomes and deliverables prior to starting a rotation project and submit a final report upon completion. An accepted or published paper may serve as the final report. If software development is involved in the project, it is important to clearly specify the deliverable at the start of the project. Students must also present their work at a department seminar.  \nFor CSI Main Track Students with interdisciplinary research interests in biomedical or public health informatics, rotation projects may involve participation in research laboratories in Biology, Chemistry, Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, or external organizations such as the CDC. BMI Students are recommended to select a domain-focused rotation faculty mentor, in addition to their advisor, who will provide the biomedical, clinical or translational domain use cases that will drive their informatics training.\nA student may earn 3 hours of course credit for each rotation project through CS598R. A single multi-semester project may continue as CS599R (not another CS598R)."

            "# 3.4 Computer Science and Informatics Ph.D. Program: Rotation Requirements (CS 598R)  \nRotation projects provide practicum opportunities to students prior to their dissertation research. The objective is to expose students to computational research problems in practical settings and to potential faculty research advisors, collaborators and thesis committee members. Rotations may also help to provide focus on a specific research area and to jump-start dissertation projects. PhD students must complete two rotation projects as part of the candidacy qualifying process; the first rotation should be completed before the start of Year 2 and the second rotation before the start of Year 3.  \nA rotation project is a three-credit hour, semester long activity with pre-defined deliverables and a final evaluation. Students register for CS598R for each rotation project under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Students will be helped by their thesis advisor (or appropriate DGS/co-DGS, if they don't have an advisor) when choosing a rotation faculty advisor. If the advisor is not a member of the CSI program faculty, then DGS approval and a co-advisor from the program are required.  \nStudents must submit a project proposal with well-defined outcomes and deliverables prior to starting a rotation project and submit a final report upon completion. An accepted or published paper may serve as the final report. If software development is involved in the project, it is important to clearly specify the deliverable at the start of the project. Students must also present their work at a department seminar.  \nFor CSI Main Track Students with interdisciplinary research interests in biomedical or public health informatics, rotation projects may involve participation in research laboratories in Biology, Chemistry, Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, or external organizations such as the CDC. BMI Students are recommended to select a domain-focused rotation faculty mentor, in addition to their advisor, who will provide the biomedical, clinical or translational domain use cases that will drive their informatics training.\nA student may earn 3 hours of course credit for each rotation project through CS598R. A single multi-semester project may continue as CS599R (not another CS598R).",

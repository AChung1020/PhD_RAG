# Section 1: Degree Programs

The mission of the LGS is to promote discovery and enduring knowledge by preparing innovative, thoughtful leaders in research, scholarship, teaching, and practice in service to the global good. In graduate education, student performance is more important than just fulfilling formal requirements. The graduate school experience may include lectures, seminars, laboratory courses, directed study, teaching opportunities, and research. A student's program of study must be planned in consultation with an appointed adviser, DGS, or advisory committee. Students can apply to a specific degree program or as a special-standing student. Special-standing students are students who may not be working towards an Emory degree. For additional information on non-degree-seeking student status, visit our Non-Degree Students website. To learn more about Emory degree programs, visit our Degree Programs page to discover the range of degree programs offered at the LGS.to discover the range of degree programs offered at the LGS.

The LGS expects students to complete a graduate program in sequence and as expeditiously as possible. Generally, students are permitted to fulfill degree requirements under the policies of the LGS and degree program handbook at the time of their first admission to the LGS. However, students may petition the program and LGS if extension or individual situations require a review of requirements.

# Section 1.1: Degree Programs: Minimum and Additional Program Requirements
The LGS sets minimum degree requirements. However, individual programs may have additional or more stringent requirements. Students should consult program handbooks, PDs, and directors of graduate studies to obtain further information on specific program requirements.

# Section 1.2: Degree Programs: Enrollment Status
Students in the LGS are enrolled in one of two forms:

Degree-Seeking: Students enrolled in courses intending to earn a Doctorate, master's degree, or certificate.

Non-Degree-Seeking: Students enrolled in one or more courses for personal or professional academic benefits but not to earn a degree.

Students must maintain enrollment by continuously registering for courses each term. If a student does not register for one or more terms or withdraws from all courses after registering, they will become inactive and must apply for readmission. Article I, Section 6 of this Handbook provides additional information on registration status.

Unless instructed otherwise by their program, all continuing degree-seeking students in the LGS can register via OPUS, the university registration system. Students are given specific instructions by email before pre-registration dates to assist with the registration process. Pre-registration dates are listed on the University Registrar and LGS websites. Before registering, students should consult their advisor and check with program staff for program-specific requirements.

# Section 1.3: Degree Programs: Transfer Credit or Programs

The LGS requires that most, if not all, credits counted toward LGS degrees be earned at Emory. Under certain circumstances, programs may appeal for up to 9 hours of transfer credit from an accredited institution to be counted in place of Emory course study if earned within seven years. No courses accepted for transfer credit can be applied toward another conferred degree. The DGS or PD must submit a written request to laneygs@emory.edu, confirm that transferred credits are not counted toward another degree, and indicate which Emory courses are deemed equivalent to the courses for which transfer credit is proposed. Any amount over 9 hours must have strong support and justification from the program and be approved by the Dean.

Students admitted with general or specific deficiencies or whose prior degrees were conferred eight or more years before admission may be required to complete additional requirements. The DGS or PD will discuss any other requirements with the student.

# Degree Programs: Change of LGS Degree Program

A student who wishes to transfer from one LGS program to another must request the DGS or the PD of both programs using the Request for Program Transfer form available on the LGS website. The request may be approved after the graduate program and the LGS Dean review. Students wishing to transfer from one program to another do not have to submit new applications or fees.

The new program DGS will recommend to LGS the number of hours credited to transfer from the prior program based on new degree objectives and requirements. Programs may prescribe additional course requirements for transferring students. The maximum credit that can be transferred from the student's former program is 18 hours.

International students must consult with the International Student and Scholar Services office about any necessary adjustment to the student's I-20.

If the student is a veteran, they must notify the Office of the Registrar at registr@emory.edu.

# Section 1.4: Degree Programs: English Language Support

The LGS English Language Support Program (ELSP) recognizes that students enter LGS with multifaceted language backgrounds and offers language instruction and consultation to help multilingual graduate students progress in graduate school.

Newly admitted LGS students who indicated on their Emory Admission application that English is not their first language must take oral and written Emory-specific language proficiency assessments or request an exemption from the ELSP.

The assessment of incoming graduate students, both master's and doctoral level, occurs in August, before the beginning of the Fall Term. ELSP coursework is required during the first year of study for students with intermediate-level language proficiency or less. Based on their assessment results, all other students enroll in ELSP to further advance their English communication skills. ELSP coursework is for credit, graded on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis, and appears on students' official transcripts.


# Section 2: Doctor of Philosophy

The program leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree provides education for a research or scholarly inquiry career. Accordingly, the degree is not conferred upon a candidate fulfilling specific requirements. Instead, the highest academic degree is awarded to students who can produce original scholarship and promise as an authority in a chosen field.

Specific requirements for the degree include but are not limited to a program of study covering a body of coherently related fields, investigation of a research problem in the major field of study, and completion of other general requirements such as the LGS TA Training and Teaching Opportunity (TATTO) and Jones Program in Ethics (JPE) programs.


# Section 2.1: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Degree Requirements: Minimum Degree Requirements
In addition to satisfying general requirements for admission to the LGS, the student seeking the Ph.D. degree must fulfill specific requirements before and during candidacy. Individual programs and divisions may specify additional and more stringent requirements. All degree requirements, including dissertation submission to the LGS, must be completed within nine years of admission.

# Section 2.1: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Degree Requirements: TA Training and Teaching Opportunity Program
In 1991, the LGS inaugurated the TA Training and Teaching Opportunity (TATTO) program to prepare students to be competent and confident instructors in various settings, including college and university classrooms. All students pursuing the Emory Ph.D. must complete the TATTO program. In addition, any student who accepts a paid TA appointment must take TATTO 600. Request for exemptions should be submitted to the Dean of Professional Development and Career Planning.

Although many universities have programs for preparing TAs, two characteristics distinguish the Emory program: (1) TATTO is a degree requirement across the LGS, and (2) TATTO is a scaffolded experience involving several stages.

For more specific information, see Section 2.6 TATTO.

# Section 2.1: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Degree Requirements: Jones Program in Ethics
The Jones Program in Ethics (JPE) provides broad and deep engagement with the ethical issues of research, scholarship, and professional life for all Ph.D. students in the LGS. This engagement will occur within broad, interdisciplinary forums and the student's graduate program. A student's engagement with ethics should cover areas relevant to the student's course of study and appropriately staged throughout a student's career.

Completion of the JPE program is required for doctoral students. For more specific information, see Section 2.7 JPE.

# Section 2.1: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Degree Requirements: Doctoral Examinations
Doctoral examinations determine the student's qualifications for advanced study and mastery of the field of specialization. The examinations must verify adequate intellectual knowledge in the student's given area and any required supporting fields. The examinations are usually prepared and


administered by the program or division of specialization, and the individual program or division determines the schedule for the general doctoral examinations. If the primary field of study lies within more than one program, the examination may be prepared and administered by a committee appointed by the LGS Dean. Credit for study completed elsewhere does not exempt the student from any part of the doctoral examinations.

As a fundamental requirement for the Ph.D. degree, a student must demonstrate mastery of methods and tools of research, the potential for productive scholarship, and promise as an authority in a particular subject. This demonstration is embodied in a dissertation setting forth the results of the student's original investigations. The dissertation must contribute to existing knowledge or be a fresh and significant critical interpretation of existing knowledge. It is actual proof of the candidate's scholarly abilities.

The dissertation, approved by the candidate's adviser and dissertation committee, must be submitted to the LGS Dean within nine years of admission. Deadlines for submission are indicated in the LGS Academic Calendar. The graduate faculties of the programs are responsible for the student's proper dissertation preparation. The LGS Dean reviews every dissertation. A dissertation is only complete once the Dean has approved it.

# Section 2.1: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Degree Requirements: Final Oral Examination
Most programs require a final oral examination or defense of the dissertation. Students should consult program regulations and advisers about program-specific requirements.

# Section 2.2: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Admission to Candidacy
Candidacy status indicates that a doctoral student has developed sufficient mastery of a discipline to produce an original research contribution in their field. Students should apply for candidacy after completing the program's preliminary degree requirements. Candidacy is a marker of program quality and reflects nationally and internationally on program success. Failure to apply for candidacy at the appropriate time can cause probation, delay fellowship continuation, and in some cases, graduation. (Note: Students cannot apply for candidacy and graduate in the same term.)

#  Section 2.2: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Admission to Candidacy: Requirements for Candidacy
To be eligible for candidacy, a student must meet the following requirements:
1. Complete all program requirements for candidacy: coursework and other training required by the degree program, including program required JPE training.
2. Complete qualifying examinations required by the degree program.
3. Obtain approval of a dissertation prospectus, if required by the degree program.
4. Complete TATTO 600, TATTO 605, and JPE 600
5. Resolve any Incomplete (I) or In Progress (IP) grades.
6. Have a minimum cumulative 2.70 GPA.
7. Have earned at least 54 credit hours at the 500 level or above.

TATTO 610 and JPE 610 may be completed after entering candidacy. Additionally, programs may reserve the dissertation prospectus and committee requirement to be met after candidacy


(see Dissertation Committee section).

Students must reach candidacy by September 15 of their fourth year. Students must meet this deadline or be placed on academic probation for the Spring term. If a student is already on probation due to previous term outcomes, another probation notation is added to the student's unofficial transcript for that term. The probation notation of P#CA (where # represents the consecutive terms of being on probation and CA represents Candidacy Application) will remain on the unofficial transcript. The candidacy probation notation will carry over each term until candidacy is reached or a DGS submits a milestone extension requestion form. Probation notations cannot be removed. Students on probation will not be eligible for Professional Development Support Funds (PDS funds) and may forfeit financial support.

Procedure
Students enter candidacy by applying for Admission to Candidacy. Instructions for how to apply for candidacy are available on the LGS website. The application requires programs to affirm that all program requirements have been met (1-3 above), and LGS confirms that the remaining requirements have been met (4-7).

Students are considered "in candidacy" when the Dean has approved the application to enter candidacy.

# Section 2.3: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Dissertation Committee: Form and Timing

LGS must approve all dissertation committees. Students must submit a program-approved dissertation committee form to LGS by March 15 of their fourth year. Students should consult their program to determine if it requires the dissertation committee form to be submitted before or after successfully defending their prospectus. Students must meet the March 15 deadline or be placed on academic probation the following term (Summer). If a student is already on probation due to previous term outcomes, another probation notation is added to the student's unofficial transcript for that term. The probation notation of P#DC (where # represents the consecutive terms of being on probation and DC represents the Dissertation Committee) will remain on the unofficial transcript. The DC probation notation will carry over each term until the dissertation committee form is submitted or a DGS submits a milestone extension requestion form. Probation notations cannot be removed. Students on probation will not be eligible for PDS funds and may forfeit financial support.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership
The LGS requires at least three committee members to belong to the LGS faculty. Emory faculty who are not LGS faculty may serve on a committee but do not count toward the three LGS faculty requirements.

LGS recognizes the value of involving scholars with expertise relevant to the interest of Ph.D. candidates who are not Emory faculty. Scholars at universities or other institutions may serve on the committee with the Dean's permission. If a committee member outside Emory is identified, the following steps should occur:

1. The DGS or division director will write a memo requesting approval from the LGS Dean. The memo should describe how this individual will contribute to the student's committee.


2. After the Dean approves the member, the student should submit the written request as part of the dissertation committee approval form.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership: Changes to the Committee
If the dissertation committee's membership needs to change, students should submit a change of dissertation committee form as soon as possible.

When a student submits a completed dissertation, the committee membership must match the members listed on the most recent dissertation committee form submitted and approved by the LGS.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership: Requesting an Extension for Chair/Advisor of the Dissertation Committee
An extension should only be requested for an LGS faculty member who has served as Chair/Advisor for one year following a change to their affiliation or location as LGS Graduate Faculty and wishes to continue to serve as Chair/Advisor for a limited extended period.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership: Emory Faculty Relocates or Retires
When any Emory dissertation committee member moves from Emory to another academic or research institution or a faculty member retires, the student should consult with their advisor and DGS or PD for guidance on how to proceed with the composition of their committee. This action ensures the student has the support and guidance to complete the dissertation project.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership: Continued Member of the Dissertation Committee

- A faculty member who moves from Emory to another academic or research institution may continue to serve as one of the three required LGS faculty members on a dissertation committee if the committee was already formed before the faculty member leaves Emory. The faculty member may serve in this capacity for up to three years after departure. Under extraordinary circumstances, the DGS or PD may petition the Dean to extend this time limit on behalf of the student.
- Retired Professors affiliated with an Emory doctoral program may continue to serve on dissertation committees as LGS faculty for five years after they retire. After five years, they may continue to serve as a member but will not remain as one of the three required LGS faculty.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership: Continued Member as Co-Chair/Co-Advisor of the Dissertation Committee
- A faculty member who currently serves as co-chair/co-advisor of a dissertation committee and moves from Emory to another academic or research institution may continue to serve as co-chair/co-advisor of the committee. They will be considered one of the three LGS faculty members for up to three years after departure, assuming the other co-chair/co-advisor is an LGS faculty member. If the other co-chair/co-advisor is not an LGS faculty member, the committee must be reconstituted to include one current LGS faculty member as co-chair/co-advisor. Under extraordinary circumstances, the DGS or PD may


petition the Dean to extend this time limit on behalf of the student. Retired Professors affiliated with an Emory doctoral program may continue to serve as co-chairs/co-advisors on dissertation committees as LGS faculty for five years after they retire. After five years, they may continue to serve as co-chair/co-advisor but will not remain as one of the three required LGS faculty.

# Section 2.4: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Membership: Continued Member as Chair/Advisor of the Dissertation Committee

- A faculty member who currently serves as chair/advisor of the dissertation committee and moves from Emory to another academic or research institution may continue to serve as chair/advisor of the committee as one of the three LGS faculty members if the student completes the dissertation within one year of the chairperson's/advisor's departure. If the student does not complete their dissertation within one year, the faculty member may continue to serve as co-chair/co-advisor with a current member of the LGS faculty for up to three years after departure.

- Retired Professors currently serving as chair/advisor of the dissertation committee may continue to serve as chair/advisor of the committee as one of the three LGS faculty members if the student completes the dissertation within one year of the chairperson's/advisor's retirement. If the student's dissertation is not completed within one year, the faculty member may continue to serve as co-chair/co-advisor with a current member of the LGS faculty for up to five years after they retire.

A program DGS may request an extension for a member of the Emory Faculty who moved from Emory or became a retired faculty member. The DGS/PD must submit a written request for an extension to the LGS Sr. Associate Dean. The request should include a list of all committee members, each member's roles (current or proposed), and the length of time as members. If functions are changing, the DGS should describe the faculty member's expertise in the dissertation topic, the reason for the extension, and the end date for an extension. See the LGS Dissertation Committee webpage for more details to request an extension.

# Section 2.5: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Dissertation Completion Time

LGS expects students to complete their dissertations and apply for graduation within six years. If students do not complete their dissertation by the end of their sixth year, programs may grant a one-year degree extension without LGS approval. Degree extensions beyond the 7th year require LGS approval. A milestone extension request form and a program approved detailed timeline for completion must be submitted to LGS for all degree extensions beyond six years. Approved degree extensions do not include guaranteed LGS funding.

# 2.6 Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) TATTO Program Overview

Four stages of the Teaching Assistance (TA) Training and Teaching Opportunity (TATTO) program provide students with a solid foundation and the opportunity to gain teaching experience in steps of increasing responsibility. With a few exceptions, a student may teach up to five terms in any combination of TA (TA) and Associate positions during the first five years at Emory. TATTO 600 and 605 must also be completed before applying for candidacy.

# 2.6 TATTO 600 Training Course

1. TATTO 600: The first stage of the TATTO program, TATTO 600, is a one-credit hour course offered in the Fall Pre-term. The course is graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory. TATTO 600 is a prerequisite for any Emory teaching assistance ship, including TATTO 605, TATTO 610, or any paid TA position at Emory. TATTO 600 should be taken immediately before a student's first teaching experience. Faculty for TATTO 600 are drawn from diverse fields of study and are committed to excellence in teaching and research. The syllabus covers topics of importance to all students, including inclusive pedagogy, lesson planning and assessment, online pedagogical tools, classroom and lab instruction, accessibility, and other responsibilities.

# 2.6 Program-Based Teaching Course

2. Program-Based Course in Teaching: In the second stage, students complete a program-based course on teaching strategies from the perspective of the student's discipline. Optimally, students enroll in this course while registering for TATTO 605, the teaching assistantship.

# 2.6 Teaching Assistantship (TATTO 605)

3. TATTO 605: The third stage of the TATTO program, TATTO 605, is a non-financially compensated, closely mentored teaching assistantship. The program and faculty mentor determine the specific responsibilities of this assistantship. In addition, the faculty member should provide continuous guidance and evaluation of the TA during the term of the teaching assistantship.

# 2.6 Teaching Associateship (TATTO 610)

4. TATTO 610: The fourth stage of the TATTO program, TATTO 610, is the Teaching Associateship, an advanced teaching opportunity. The LGS favors a co-teaching model for this stage, in which the student and a faculty member collaborate in all aspects of a course, from syllabus design to final grading. In many programs, Teaching Associates are primarily responsible for teaching a course of their design. In all cases, teaching associates receive attentive mentoring and evaluation. Students register for TATTO 610 during the term of the Teaching Associateship position.

# 2.6 Dean's Teaching Fellowship

Students who demonstrate exceptional teaching ability may qualify to apply for the Dean's Teaching Fellowship. To be eligible for consideration, a student must have completed all LGS and program requirements (except the dissertation) and been admitted to Ph.D. candidacy. Dean's Teaching Fellows have complete responsibility for the course they teach. LGS offers a number of these merit-based fellowships to students, usually in their sixth year, on a competitive basis.
# Section 2.6: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) TATTO Program: TATTO Credit

The Registrar notes TATTO credit on transcripts, documenting fulfillment of the degree
requirement. TATTO 600 must be completed unless an equivalent number of hours of formal
instruction in teaching assistance has been met. In such cases, the student's DGS should submit a
written request for exemption to the Assistant Dean of Professional Development and Career
Planning, outlining the student's teaching experience. If the prior experience closely matches a
given TATTO requirement in intellectual scope and duration, that requirement may be waived.

# Section 2.6: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) TATTO Program: Teaching Assistance and Associates (TA)

The stages of the TATTO program are intended to ensure that Ph.D. students are adequately
prepared for various instructional roles and that a student's opportunities to learn in the
classroom grow with experience. In addition, TATTO prepares our students to apply this
knowledge in various professional settings inside and outside the academy.

The titles TA and teaching associate designate a student's progress through the TATTO program. TA


experience varies from program to program. The defining characteristic of this opportunity across all programs is a mentored initial teaching experience. A TA may be responsible for 10 to 12 hours per week of discussion, laboratory supervision, etc. The Teaching Associate experience advances the student to a teaching opportunity with more significant learning experiences, sometimes in a co-teaching arrangement with a faculty member. In some programs, the student and faculty collaborate on all aspects of a course, from syllabus design to final grading. In other programs, a teaching associate could learn from teaching an entire class with ongoing mentoring.

In compliance with recommendations of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, students may only be the instructor of record for a course after they have completed at least 18 hours of graduate credit in their teaching field.

A student may only be a TA or teaching associate for up to five terms during their first five years at Emory with the approval of the Assistant Dean of Professional Development and Career Planning. Students wishing to teach more than five terms as either a TA or teaching associate should submit a letter of request to the Dean explaining their rationale for desiring these additional educational opportunities.

# Section 2.7: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Jones Program in Ethics

The Jones Program in Ethics (JPE) provides broad and deep engagement with the ethical issues of research, scholarship, and professional life for all Ph.D. students in the LGS. This engagement will occur within broad, interdisciplinary forums and the student's graduate program. A student's engagement with ethics should cover areas relevant to the student's course of study and be appropriately staged throughout a student's career.

# Section 2.7: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Jones Program in Ethics: Program Elements

There are three elements of the JPE. Completion of all aspects (1) and (2) is required for candidacy, and (3) is required for graduation.

1. JPE 600: Students take a 6-hour course in scholarly integrity, supported by the LGS. The course is graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory. This course has no associated credit hours, but completion is a graduation requirement. Incoming students beginning their first year of graduate studies must register for JPE 600. Students should discuss the appropriate course registration time with their Program Administrators. Participation in this course is recorded on the student's transcript.

2. Program-based training: Students will complete at least 6 hours of training in program-based ethics material. The disposition of this time is at the program's discretion. This training may occur within existing courses, such as methodology or professionalization. It may also take the form of faculty-led workshops or journal clubs. This part of the program intends to promote student discussions with their program faculty and to integrate explicit attention to ethics into the regular course of graduate education. The student's program monitors student participation in this element of JPE. The student's program indicates on the candidacy form that students have fulfilled at least 6 hours of program-based material.

3. JPE 610: Students will also participate in at least 4 JPE 610 sessions designated by the LGS as eligible for ethics training credit. JPE 610 sessions occur regularly throughout


the academic year and are listed on the JPE website. All sessions align with at least
one of JPE's areas of scholarly integrity, align with the JPE program outcomes, and are
delivered by faculty, staff, or partners with expertise in the subject matter.
Participation is recorded on the student's transcript as sections of JPE 610.

# Section 2.7: Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Jones Program in Ethics: JPE Credit
The Registrar notes participation in JPE 600 (1 section) and JPE 610 (4 sections) on each student's
transcript, which signifies fulfillment of the degree requirement.

# Section 3: Master's Degrees
A master's degree is conferred upon a candidate who completes all requirements in an approved
program. Only a few programs accept applicants solely for master's study. Students admitted to
terminal master's degree programs at Emory may not pursue a doctoral program without submitting a
complete application to the Ph.D. program. Additionally, unlike full-time doctoral students in LGS, the
financial support available for master's students is limited. Master's students can enroll in the Emory
University Student Health Insurance Plan (EUSHIP) but will be responsible for the health insurance
premium and all student fees.

# Section 3: Master's Degrees: Master Degree Types
LGS offers two types of master's degrees:

1. An interim master's degree: This degree type, available in some programs, is designed as an
   intermediate step for students who are on their way to earning a Ph.D.

2. A terminal master's degree: This degree acts as a standalone degree for students who wish to
   specialize in a certain field without pursuing a Ph.D. It further provides a potential exit point
   for Ph.D. students who, for any reason, choose to discontinue their graduate study.

Students seeking a Ph.D. should discuss both master's degree options with their program's DGS, as the
requirements for both types of degrees can vary across programs.

# Section 3.1: Minimum Master's Degree Requirements
The LGS sets the minimum requirements (also known as "standard requirements") for the terminal and
interim master's degree. Minimum requirements include satisfactory completion of at least 30 credit
hours. Minimum requirements also include the following:
- At least 15 credit hours in courses or seminars. This does not include Directed Study 597
  or Research 599.
- At least 11 credit hours must be at the 500 or 700 levels.
- A B- or better grade must be earned in at least 11 credit hours of courses.
- Courses at the 100 or 200 level do not apply towards a master's degree.
- Terminal master's degree only: A written thesis, subject to the limitations described in
  Section 3.2.

# Section 3.2: Alternative Requirements for the Terminal Master's
The only minimum degree requirement that can be changed is the written thesis. Programs may seek
approval from the LGS Executive Council to substitute a different assessment for the written thesis.
Additionally, programs must seek approval from the Executive Council to add additional degree
requirements, including but not limited to additional required credit hours, required courses,


examinations, foreign language, or other research skills. These additional requirements must be deemed relevant to a student's course of study. Students should consult programs for specific details.

If a program requires a written thesis, a student must submit an acceptable thesis demonstrating an ability to use the methods of advanced investigation or research. The nature of the thesis, as well as its form, varies among the different fields. The thesis is submitted to LGS after the student's advisory committee approves the thesis. The student's advisory committee requires two members of the LGS graduate faculty. The LGS Dean reviews every thesis. The deadline for submitting a thesis to the Dean is listed in the academic calendar. Students must be registered in the term in which they receive the degree. Before the Dean accepts the thesis, the program must certify that the student has completed all requirements for the degree.

# Section 3.3: Doctoral Students Discontinuing their Ph.D. and Approved for a Terminal Master's
Doctoral students who discontinue their graduate study for any given reason may be eligible for a terminal master's degree at Emory. A student must request approval for a change to a terminal master's degree status, the term in which the student seeks to receive the terminal master's. This request for approval must be submitted before the degree application deadline for the relevant term.

If completion of the terminal master's degree extends beyond the term approved for the master's degree, the student may receive a tuition scholarship but will not receive a stipend or student health insurance. Students will be responsible for the EUSHIP premium and remain responsible for all student fees.

# Section 3.4: Master's based on Candidacy and Interim Master's degrees
Some, but not all, programs allow students to earn a master's degree based on doctoral candidacy. A student granted program approval to file for a master's based on candidacy must meet all LGS and program requirements for the master's degree (except for the thesis) and submit a Completion Form to LGS. LGS will not award a master's degree based on candidacy retroactively after a student has completed the Ph.D.; therefore, students must apply for the master's degree immediately upon reaching eligibility.

# Section 3.5: Maximum Time to Complete the Master's Degree
A student must complete all requirements for a terminal master's degree within five years of admission. If students do not complete their degree by the end of their fifth year, programs may grant a one-year degree extension without LGS approval. Degree extensions beyond the 6th year require LGS approval. A milestone extension request form and a program approved detailed timeline for completion must be submitted to LGS for all degree extensions beyond five years.

A student beyond the five-year limit who fails to obtain an extension from their program or exhausts the extension granted without completing the requirements for the degree will no longer be considered an active degree-seeking student.

# Section 4: Graduate Certificates

Graduate certificate programs provide graduate students with interdisciplinary expertise. Certificates will enhance student education and research and expand students' professional competencies. Students interested in a Graduate Certificate should consult the Certificate PD about eligibility criteria and requirements. More information on the active certificate program can


be found on the LGS website.

# Section 4.1: Graduate Certificates: Declaration
Once accepted to the desired certificate program, students should complete and submit to LGS a Certificate Declaration Form, found on the LGS website.

# Section 4.2: Graduate Certificates: Credits
Students may enroll in more than one certificate program, but up to three credits may be counted toward two certificates. If a student is enrolled in a degree program because certificates are intended to enhance interdisciplinary education, up to three credits from a student's home program may be counted toward any certification. Transfer credits may not be applied toward certificate requirements.

# Section 4.3: Graduate Certificates: Completion
Completing a certificate program requires at least 12 credits of course study at the 500 to 700 level. Certificates must have some requirements, in addition to the minimum credit hours, that make the course of study systematic and cohesive; This may take the form of required core courses, exams, projects, or practicum.

Upon finishing the certificate program requirements, the student must obtain and submit a completed Certificate Clearance Form documenting the completion of the requirements.

If the student is earning a degree and a certificate, the student should complete an Application for a Degree in addition to the Application for a Degree submitted for the dissertation; This will allow the certificate to be noted on the transcript. Students will not be awarded a paper certificate. Certificates are only notated on student transcripts. Students obtaining a certificate in Translational Research not enrolled in an Emory Ph.D. program are an exception. Students should contact their program for additional information.

# Section 5: Dual and Joint Degrees

# Section 5.1: Dual Degrees
Dual degrees are typically pursued and completed in stages and are awarded sequentially. The LGS requires that all dual degree programs be allowed a maximum of 20% of credit hours to be double-counted or exchanged toward the dual degree. For example, if a master's degree consists of 30 credit hours, a maximum of 6 credit hours may be double counted with the other degree.

# Section 5.2: Joint degrees
Joint degrees are typically pursued in a mixed curriculum and awarded together.

# Section 5.3: 4+1 Dual Degrees
Available to baccalaureate students enrolled in Emory College of Arts and Sciences (ECAS), the LGS offers several 4+1 dual degree programs, which bridge the undergraduate senior year with a fifth ("+1") year of graduate study in the LGS, resulting in the awarding of the master's degree by the LGS. Visit our Bachelor/Master's Programs page to view offerings.


# Section 5.4: Four-Year Bachelor's/Master's Programs

Exceptional Emory College of Arts and Sciences (ECAS) students with superior undergraduate records may be eligible for a combined degree program where bachelor's and master's degrees are awarded conjointly at the end of four years. ECAS departments reserve the option of offering such a program and selecting students for participation. Interested undergraduates should consult their departments as early as possible for details. A Four-Year Bachelor's/Master's Application for Admission must be submitted during the spring semester of the junior year (before commencement), along with the departmental recommendation letter for the program. The LGS will only recognize students as dual-degree students if these steps are completed before the deadline.

Visit our Bachelor/Master's Programs page to view offerings.

# Section 6: Registration Status and Academic Performance

There are two registrations statuses:

- **Active:** A student currently enrolled in any course or program for which the student is registered.

- **Inactive:** A student not currently enrolled in any course or program. A student who does not maintain continuous enrollment each term will be discontinued and become inactive. Students on an approved leave of absence will also be listed as inactive. To return to active status, a student must apply for readmission.

# Section 6.1: Registration Status and Academic Performance: Readmission

Students who fail to maintain continuous registration become inactive and are ineligible for funding and health insurance. Inactive students must apply for readmission.

Students not enrolled for one or more terms must apply for readmission; This is required for students on an approved leave of absence and those who allowed their enrollment to lapse without obtaining an approved leave and become discontinued. Students who fail to maintain continuous enrollment must submit an online form and apply for readmission at least 30 days before the term they wish to re-register.

The first step in applying for readmission is contacting the program's DGS. Next, the student must submit a readmission form on the LGS website. Finally, the student's program will be asked to approve the readmission application. Readmission is approved at the discretion of the program or division, which may also prescribe additional course requirements.

Consideration for readmission includes a student's academic standing and review of their pre-approved plan for return that outlines timely academic progress at the end of the last term registered, including any incomplete grades converted to an F or U during the student's absence. Students who have exceeded the nine-year enrollment limit on the time to degree cannot be readmitted.

Students with enrollment holds must contact Emory's Office of Student Accounts and Billing or other appropriate office and apply for readmission once the hold has been removed.

Students who decide not to continue their graduate study in a doctoral program and switch to a


terminal master's degree may be readmitted into the doctoral program from which they intend to earn their terminal master's degree.

#  Section 6.1: Registration Status and Academic Performance: Readmission for Non-degree seeking students.
Students not enrolled for one or more terms must apply for readmission by completing the online process for non-degree readmission at least 30 days before enrollment.

# Section 6.2: Academic Expectations and Grades

Academic expectations are standards and goals set to achieve success in an academic program. It is essential and expected that students understand performance expectations to maintain satisfactory progress as defined by their academic program and LGS. There are several ways in which performance expectations can be defined and communicated, including but not limited to a course syllabus, program handbook, faculty expectations, academic and research integrity standards, meeting academic milestones, etc. Understanding performance expectations is essential. Communication between students and faculty is expected and critical to receive a satisfactory grade in a course.

# Section 6.2: Academic Expectations and Grades: Grading System
The symbols A, A-, B+, B, B-, C, F, W, WF, S, U, WU, IP, I, IF/IU, and AUD are used in the LGS to indicate the following:

| Grade | Meaning                                         | Quality Points  |
|---|---|---|
| A | Superior                                        | 4.0             |
| A- |                                                 | 3.7             |
| B+ |                                                 | 3.3             |
| B | Satisfactory                                    | 3.0             |
| B- |                                                 | 2.7             |
| C | Marginal                                        | 2.0             |
| F | Failing                                         | 0.0             |
| S | Satisfactory*                                   |                 |
| U | Unsatisfactory*                                 |                 |
| W | Withdrawal without penalty*                     |                 |
| WF | Withdrawal while failing                        | 0.0             |
| WU | Withdrawal while performing unsatisfactorily*   |                 |
| IP | In progress* |
| I | Incomplete* |
| IF/IU | Incomplete failing / Incomplete unsatisfactory |
| AUD | Audit* |

\* These grades are not included in calculating a student's grade point average; additionally, students must be enrolled in the courses they audit.

# Section 6.2: Academic Expectations and Grades: Grading Basis

In some programs, a student can take courses outside their program of study on either a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) or a letter-grade basis. Students should consult their DGS, PD, or advisors to determine whether the S/U or letter grade option is allowed within the program or division and what restrictions may apply. The grades of F, IF U, W, WF, WU, IP, I, or IU are not counted toward degree or credit hour requirements.

Two tentative status notations may be given:

1. An I notation (incomplete) is appropriate when a student fails to complete all requirements for a course by the end of the term due to an illness or some other unforeseen circumstance.

2. An IP notation (in progress) may only be used for courses that run two consecutive terms. An IP may not be assigned to 599R or 799R courses. LGS must approve sequential courses that require or use IP grades. IP grades are inappropriate for courses designed to be one term in length.

A student must resolve all incomplete (I) or in-progress (IP) courses before candidacy and graduation.

# Section 6.2: Academic Expectations and Grades: Failure to Complete a Course

When course assignments or research expectations are not completed in a term, the instructor may assign a grade of I (incomplete). The instructor and student should discuss and document the time needed to fulfill requirements and align with the program's policy. Questions should be directed to the program DGS or LGS. If assignments are not completed within one calendar year (12 months), the LGS will change the grade from I to IF or IU (depending on the grading basis). A grade of IF or IU is deemed unsatisfactory, resulting in probation.

A grade of IF or IU is considered final. Therefore, it can only be changed through a request submitted by the instructor to the LGS, citing compelling reasons for the grade change. The Emory Registrar approves final requests.

# 6.3 Academic Performance and Status: Minimum Academic Standards

The LGS sets minimum academic standards for satisfactory academic performance. Programs may establish more stringent standards. The LGS defines unsatisfactory as any one of the following:

- A cumulative GPA of less than 2.7
- A GPA in any term of less than 2.7
- Receipt of a grade of F, U, IF, or IU in any course
- Receipt of two or more incompletes in a term, or
- Having a total of two unresolved incomplete grades on their academic record
- Receipt of an incomplete in a 9-credit hour course.

# 6.3 Academic Performance and Status: Probationary Status

A student with unsatisfactory academic performance is on probation for one term. Some programs may have more stringent academic performance expectations during the probationary term. Students should discuss program terms and conditions of probation and reinstatement to satisfactory standing with their DGS or PD.

# 6.3 Academic Performance and Status: Return to Good Standing

For probationary periods caused by the failure to make satisfactory academic progress as defined above by LGS, students will automatically return to good standing in the subsequent term. However, a student who fails to meet LGS or program standards for satisfactory performance in the following term will be placed on probation for a second term.

# 6.3 Academic Performance and Status: Probation Notation

The probation notation will remain on the unofficial transcript for one term unless there is cause for another probation for a different reason. Probation notations cannot be removed. Probation codes are as follows (where # represents the consecutive number of terms on probation):

P#GR: Grades
P#GP: GPA
P#CA: Candidacy Application Milestone
P#DC: Dissertation Committee Milestone
P#OT: Other Reason

# 6.3 Academic Performance and Status: Academic Recovery Plan

The student and director must develop a plan to return to good standing and consult the LGS Office of Student Affairs.

# Section 6.4: Satisfactory Progress

LGS considers a student making progress toward the degree if they are in good standing and meet one of the following conditions:

- Enroll each term of the academic year for a minimum of 9 graded credit hours with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7.
- In candidacy and submitted a dissertation or thesis (terminal programs).
- Registered in 799R (dissertation research) of 599R (thesis research) and meet the registration requirements. Note: Only students in candidacy may enroll in 799R.
- Granted an approved extension period and meets the above registration requirements.
- The student is on an LGS-approved leave of absence. Note: Loan and federal agencies might not recognize a leave of absence as grounds for deferment.

# Section 6.4: Satisfactory Progress: Program Dismissal

LGS will permanently dismiss a student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress and merits three consecutive probationary terms unless the program provides written justification for the student's continuation. LGS will also consider recommendations for dismissing a student who merits two consecutive probations or fails to meet other academic standards consistent with their


program's policy. In the event of dismissal, international students must notify International Student and Scholar Services.

Students recommended for academic dismissal by their academic program will receive a letter from their program informing them of the reasons for the recommendation for dismissal. Students will have five business days from the date of the program dismissal letter to inform their DGS and the LGS Student Affairs Dean of their intent to appeal the recommendation for dismissal. Students must begin and follow their program handbook appeal process within five business days of notifying their DGS and LGS Student Affairs Dean of their intent to appeal actions leading to the recommendation of the dismissal. Students are also strongly encouraged to meet with the LGS Student Affairs Dean to review the process and have their questions answered.

In most cases, programs will respond to the appeal in writing within 30 days of receipt of the complaint. However, exceptions to this timeframe may be allowed with reasonable and regular communication to inform the student of the complaint's status. Programs must inform the LGS Student Affairs Dean in writing of the outcome of the appeal before the end of the term in which the case is being reviewed. If the matter cannot be resolved within the program, or the student disagrees with the resolution, the student may submit a complaint to the LGS Committee on Grievances. Grievance Procedures are outlined in Part IV of this Handbook. A student's decision to file a grievance will not delay the dismissal action.

# Section 6.4: Permanent Academic Record (Transcripts)

The transcript is a permanent and official student academic performance record. The Office of the University Registrar maintains the transcript. Copies of transcripts can be requested via OPUS, by email, or in person and can be in electronic or printed format. Visit the Office of the University Registrar for more information.

# Section 6.5: Grade Appeals

Students who believe an assigned grade is incorrect should first discuss the assigned grade with the instructor. Students who still disagree with the instructor should address their concerns to the graduate studies or PD, who will seek to resolve the matter with the instructor and the student. Consistent with principles of academic freedom, responsibility for evaluating a student's course performance rests with the instructor. Using this procedure to resolve a grade dispute will not prejudice a student's rights under the LGS or University student grievance procedures.

# Section 6.6: Sealing Student Records

The conferral of an Emory University degree is the most important milestone in a student's academic career. Therefore, graduating students must fulfill all the academic requirements for the degree requirements before the date of conferral set by the University Registrar's Office. After students graduate, their records are sealed, and no further changes are allowed. The correction of clerical mistakes is possible by petitioning the University Registrar. View the full Emory policy on the University Registrar's website.

# Section 7.1: Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence: Voluntary Withdrawals


A voluntary withdrawal occurs when a student chooses to leave Emory during a term and requests to be withdrawn from all classes after the Add/Drop/Swap deadline has passed. A student who decides to withdraw from their program of study should consult with the DGS or PD. International students must discuss their withdrawal plans with International Student and Scholar Services to determine how the withdrawal will impact their visa status. If the student is a veteran, they must contact the Office of the Registrar at registr@emory.edu to confirm that their enrollment change does not affect their certificate of eligibility.

# Section 7.2: Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence: Involuntary Withdrawals

A student may be withdrawn involuntarily from Emory if the University determines that the student represents a direct threat to the health and safety of themself or others by:

1. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that poses a high probability of substantial harm to themself or others; or

2. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that would cause significant property damage would directly and substantially impede the lawful activities of others or interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University.

Withdrawals in such cases shall normally incur no academic penalty for the term the student is enrolled, and a tuition refund, if any, shall be based on the schedule established for voluntary withdrawal. Because the involuntary withdrawal policy applies to cases where there is a concern about the safety of the student or others, the Dean or their designee may require a student involuntarily withdrawn under this policy to be re-evaluated before they are readmitted.

# Section 7.3: Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence: Leaves of Absence

A student may be granted two one-year leave (no more than six terms) of absence upon recommendation of the student's program and approval of the Dean. Leaves of absence (LOA) are available to students only within five years of admission. The student must demonstrate that during this period, they must interrupt progress toward the degree. The student should be aware that the University will not certify to loan officers or government agencies that a student on an LOA is enrolled in or actively pursuing a course of study. International students must discuss their LOA plans with International Student and Scholar Services to determine how the LOA will impact their visa status. If the student is a veteran, they must contact the Office of the Registrar at registr@emory.edu.

In most cases, a student must be in good standing and have no incomplete assignments to be eligible for an LOA. In addition, time spent on an LOA does not count toward the nine-year limit for the doctoral degree or the five-year limit for the terminal master's degree. Students beyond these limits are not eligible for leave but may apply for an extension of the time allowed to complete degree requirements per the rules governing such extension.

An LOA is not used to resolve academic difficulties or finish incomplete assignments. Instead, this policy is intended to allow students to leave academic life for a specified period. During which they do not progress toward the degree. Examples of an LOA include:

- a unique professional or educational circumstance,
- short-term disabilities, or
- competing responsibilities that preclude meaningful progress toward the degree.

Circumstances pertaining to pregnancy, childbirth, and childcare should first be considered through our Parental Arrangement policy but may also be addressed through the LOA policy. Students should develop a written plan and timeline for their leave and return and consult their DGS, Faculty Mentor, and the LGS Student Affairs office before submitting a request for an LOA.

A student returning to the LGS after an LOA should request readmission at least 30 days before the beginning of the term they wish to return.

# Section 9: Parental Arrangements

Parental Arrangements are for students with parental responsibility due to childbirth, care of a newborn, or a newly adopted child. This policy guarantees LGS students a minimum level of arrangements and academic modification while welcoming a new child into their family. Graduate students should develop and discuss plans with their advisors and DGS or PD and consult LGS Student Affairs Dean.

# Section 9.1:Parental Arrangements: Policy

LGS students designated as the caregiver, having parental responsibility, may be allowed parental arrangements and academic modification(s) of graduate responsibilities for up to eight weeks after the birth or adoption of a child. Students may use up to four weeks before the anticipated birth or adoption date. Modifications, including length of time for master's students, are on a case-by-case basis and worked out between the student, academic program advisor, and the DGS depending on the students' stage of degree progress, i.e., coursework, teaching, research, and nature of the research environment. Students are not employees and thus are not subject to Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provisions.

# Section 9.2: Parental Arrangements: Eligibility

Any matriculated LGS student in good academic standing.

# Section 9.3: Parental Arrangements: Stipend Support

Eligible students receiving stipend support should continue to receive it throughout the arrangements. NIH allows grant funds to be used for this purpose, provided it follows our institutional policy. Many other federal agencies have their policies regarding parental arrangements. If the sponsor does not allow stipend support during this timeframe, LGS Finance will work with the faculty and the program to ensure funding is available at Emory.

During these eight weeks, students are expected to maintain registration, remain in contact with their advisor, and engage in minimal academic activity (e.g., reading), as agreed upon by the student and their advisor, assuming the student's and child's good health. After eight weeks, students resume their responsibilities, and if students need additional arrangements, they should speak with their DGS and the LGS Student Affairs Dean.

# Section 9.4: Parental Arrangements: Arrangement Principles

Enrollment status: Parental Arrangements are not a Leave of Absence. Students with parental arrangements will remain full-time students. Thus, their eligibility for graduate student benefits remains
intact (e.g., student stipend and health insurance benefits). However, students may prefer to apply for a
Leave of Absence if they need additional time.

# Section 9.4: Parental Arrangements: Arrangement Principles: Suspension of academic requirements

**Suspension of academic requirements**: Students with parental arrangements may be relieved of full-
time academic and related educational activities, such as teaching and research assistant academic
requirements, official academic examinations such as qualifying or preliminary examinations, lab and
research deadlines, and course activity.

- Scheduled courses or examinations should be rescheduled to avoid conflicts during the parental
arrangement period; rescheduling should provide reasonable time to complete these academic
requirements. If the amount of coursework to be rescheduled is excessive, the student may
need to drop a course and retake it another term.
- The student's program will develop a plan to replace required academic activities, such as
teaching and research. LGS expects that the program will exercise flexibility in this process.
Contact the LGS Dean of Student Affairs for clarification if necessary.

# Section 9.5: Parental Arrangements: Arrangement Procedures

Students seeking arrangements should email their program (through their DGS/PD, advisor, and LGS) at
least three months before the arrangements are anticipated (unless unforeseen circumstances arise) for
programs to have adequate time to plan any activity that other students might carry out. Students are
expected to consider the needs of their programs and collaborators in determining when to inform their
programs of needed arrangements. In some instances, additional time is warranted to meet program
requirements. Before submitting the request to LGS, students must discuss arrangements with their
advisors and DGS /PD. Carefully review the form and instructions for the Parental Arrangement Request.

# Section 10: Degree Completion

A student approaching the end of a degree program must meet all program, LGS, and University
requirements and deadlines. Failure to do so may result in receiving the degree the following term. All
deadlines are published on the LGS Academic Calendar. Details are on the Degree Completion page on
the LGS website.

# Section 10.1: Degree Completion: Registration and Awarding of Degrees

Students must be registered full-time in the term they receive their degrees. If students have yet to
defend, they should: enroll in course 599R if not in candidacy or 799R if they are in candidacy. If the
student has defended, they should enroll in the appropriate course to satisfy the requirement. Master's
students should enroll in course 599R.

# Section 10.2: Degree Completion: Application for Degree

Students must submit a formal Application for a Degree to be awarded a degree in a particular term:
spring, summer, or fall. The form is available on the LGS website on the LGS Degree Completion page.
The application can also be completed online in OPUS if the student's record indicates that the current
term is their anticipated graduation term.

Degree applications are valid only for the term in which they are filed. Therefore, a student who
applies for the degree and does not complete all requirements must apply again and register full-time
for the term in which the student will receive the degree.


# Section 10.3: Degree Completion: Degree Clearance Form (Completion of Requirements Report)

The Degree Clearance Form certifies that the student has completed all requirements. Students receiving a master's degree must attach a copy of their transcript to the form. Note: Students must upload their theses or dissertations to the Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD) Repository before submitting the required documents to LGS. Dates for receipt of forms can be found on the LGS Academic Calendar.

Candidates must resolve all incomplete grades and P and IP grades before submitting the Clearance Form.

# Section 10.4: Degree Completion: Dissertation or Thesis Submission

All dissertations and theses are submitted electronically through the ETD Repository. The electronic copy submitted to the ETD Repository becomes the official and archival record copy.

The LGS reviews the dissertation, and the Dean must approve it before a student can be cleared to graduate.

Detailed instructions are available on the LGS website.

# Section 10.5: Degree Completion: Graduate Education Exit Survey and Survey of Earned Doctorates

LGS requires that Ph.D. candidates complete two online surveys: the LGS Graduate Education Exit Survey and the Survey of Earned Doctorates. Upon completion of each survey, students receive a certificate of completion. Certificates should be saved and submitted when submitting a degree completion form and other required documents. Master's students are only required to complete and submit the Graduate Education Exit Survey for master's students.

# Section 10.6: Degree Completion: ProQuest/UMI Publishing Agreement

All Ph.D. candidates must complete and submit the ProQuest/UMI Publishing Agreement. Copyrighting is optional. Master's degree candidates do not need to publish their theses with ProQuest/UMI but may do so. Master's degree candidates who want to copyright their theses can do so through ProQuest/UMI.

# Section 10.7: Degree Completion: Master's Degree based on Candidacy

Some doctoral programs award master's degrees to students who have reached doctoral candidacy. Students receiving a master's based on candidacy must submit Candidacy, Application for Degree, and Degree Clearance forms to LGS by the published deadlines. (See the LGS Academic Calendar)

# Section 10.8: Degree Completion: Financial Obligations to the University

All financial obligations to the University must be cleared before a student graduates. These obligations include tuition, student health charges, parking fines, and library fines, if any. Failure to settle outstanding charges will place holds on diplomas, transcripts, and other student records. Eligibility for stipend expires when a student graduates.

# Section 10.9: Degree Completion: Commencement Ceremony

University commencement is held annually at the end of the spring term.

Students who graduate in the summer and fall should indicate whether they expect to return for commencement in the spring and update their OPUS record to ensure it contains a permanent email address to confirm their attendance plans.


Students with a FERPA information suppression hold on their personal information should know that their names will not be printed in the commencement program. Names will be published only if the FERPA hold is removed, and the hold can be removed only by the University Registrar's office.

# Section 10.10: Degree Completion: Diploma Notation and Name

Students should note that while transcripts will show majors and degrees received, diplomas will only show the degree received. Only the degree obtained is displayed on a diploma, not the major field. For example, a student receiving a Ph.D. in English will receive a diploma stating that they have been awarded the Doctor of Philosophy, not the Doctor of Philosophy in English. The same applies to master's diplomas.

Before graduation, students should update their permanent mailing and email addresses in OPUS.

The diploma from Emory University will be printed with the student's official name as it appears in OPUS. For more information, see Emory's name policy at http://policies.emory.edu/10.1.

# Section 11: Registration

Unless instructed otherwise by the program, all continuing degree-seeking students in the LGS can register via OPUS. To assist with the registration process, students are given specific instructions by email before pre-registration dates. Also, students should pay attention to program instructions regarding registration and must settle their accounts with Emory's Student Financial Services.

# Section 11.1: Registration: Continuous Registration

Students must maintain continuous registration throughout their course of study in the LGS. If a student does not register for one term or more or withdraws after registering, the student will become inactive and must apply for readmission.

# Section 11.1: Continuing Students Registration: Registration Procedures

There are two steps to registration: signing up for courses and paying or arranging for payment of outstanding accounts. Students should check with program staff before pre-registration for program-specific requirements.

# Section 11.1: Registration: Signing up for Courses

After complying with program procedures, students may pre-register in OPUS. Pre-registration dates are published on the Office of the Registrar's website and the LGS Academic Calendar. Students are responsible for obtaining the required program approval for their schedules and verifying that their registration is correct.

Special-standing students may not use OPUS to pre-register. Special-standing students must obtain the required signatures from course instructors and programs. Some programs require special-standing students to obtain permission from the DGS or PD. Special-standing students submit instructor approvals to the LGS. The LGS will enter the schedule in OPUS on the first day of registration.


# Section 11.3: Payment of Accounts

After a student's schedule is entered into OPUS, Student Financial Services generates an electronic invoice posted in OPUS. The registrar will notify the student of this posting by emailing the student's Emory email address. The Office of Student Financial Services does not mail paper statements. Students must register and pay their bills. Accounts will reflect charges, anticipated aid, and an account summary. Bills are payable upon receipt. Students should follow instructions from The Office of Student Financial Services on their website.

Registration may be canceled for students with outstanding balances on their accounts. Students who fail to enroll in courses and do not pay their bills by the end of add/drop will result in their registration and LGS financial award (tuition scholarship, stipend, and health insurance subsidy) being cancelled.

# Section 11.4: Course Load and Adjustments

The average course load for a student in full-time status is nine credit hours during fall, spring, and summer terms. Some programs require students to register for 12 hours per term. The maximum number of credits allowed in any term is 16. Any additional credits should be reviewed and approved by the DGS or PD and the LGS.

# Section 11.4: Course Load and Adjustments

Students' schedules can be adjusted during the University add/drop period. Any adjustments, including changing grading options, should be made with the approval of the student's faculty adviser and the DGS or PD. Students may make changes through OPUS but must obtain program approval first. Only the LGS can adjust a schedule after the add/drop period through the date of record. After the Registrar's date of record, no adjustments will be made. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that the course schedule adjustments are properly made before the date of record.

# Section 11.5: Grading Options

Students take graduate-level courses for letter grades (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C, or F). Upon program approval, students may take a limited number of courses as S/U (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). Degree-seeking students also may audit graduate courses with the permission of their program and the course instructor. The Registrar's calendar lists the last date on which changes in grading basis may be made in any term.

# Section 11.6: Withdrawal

A student wishing to drop a course or completely withdraw after the add/drop date must complete the Withdrawal Signature Form. The instructor for each course must assign a grade of W, WF, or WU. Courses with a grade of W will not count toward candidacy. Withdrawing from courses and dropping below full-time status may result in recalculating student financial aid for the term. The exact consequences will depend on several factors, including the type and amount of financial aid the student has received and the official withdrawal date.

# Section 11.7: Undergraduate Courses

Programs sometimes suggest or require that students take undergraduate-level language courses to fulfill foreign language requirements. Permission by programs and instructors must be granted before enrolling in undergraduate courses.


# Section 11.8: Student Loan Deferment

Registration status may affect the status of student loan deferments. Only students registered for nine or more credit hours are recognized as pursuing a full-time degree status. The LGS will certify full-time enrollment for those students. Students are advised to consult with their lending agencies for specific enrollment requirements.

# Section 11.9: Dual Registration

Students may only enroll in one school of the University at a time. An LGS student who wishes to take a course in a degree program offered by another school at Emory must obtain permission from their advisor, the course instructor, and the DGS/PD. The student registers through the LGS, and course credit will apply only toward the student's LGS degree program. Courses taken may count only toward a single degree.

Students in recognized joint or dual degree programs, such as the JD/Ph.D., will be accommodated in ways that vary from program to program.

# Section 11.10: Cross Registration – Atlanta Regional Consortium for Higher Education (ARCHE)

Emory participates in the Atlanta Regional Consortium for Higher Education cross-registration agreement. Students may take courses on a space-available basis at member institutions if the course is not offered concurrently at the home institution. Participating institutions are listed on the ARCHE website. Before cross-registering, students must obtain permission from their advisers and their programs. In addition, many participating schools require certain immunizations, and students may be required to produce copies of immunization records before cross-registering. Students interested in cross-registration should email arche@registrar.emory.edu or call 404-727-6042.

# Section 11.11: Registrar

The Office of the Registrar at Emory University is responsible for supporting the academic progress of all students by ensuring the accuracy of all student records, with a particular emphasis on processes related to maintaining efficient and accurate systems for student registration and enrollment, faculty grading, and transcript production, and for upholding the school's academic policies and procedures. For more information, visit the Registrar's website.

# Section 12: Amendments

The Emory University by-laws provide that the faculty is responsible for instructional programs under the direction of the President (Instruction, 25). The LGS Dean is responsible for the general direction of the graduate school and exercises leadership in developing educational policies and programs (Instruction 26). In practice, these responsibilities are closely intertwined. Reflecting this connection, LGS operates via a shared governance model. Amendments to the LGS Handbook require approval of the LGS Executive Council when they materially alter policies related to (1) the approval of new programs and courses; and (2) maintaining, revising, and implementing appropriate discipline standards of quality for admission, instruction, and student research in the LGS. Handbook amendments that merely clarify existing policy do not require Executive Council Approval.

# Article II: Financial Information


Graduate students might engage with four primary contacts regarding financial information while pursuing their degree.

1. Emory University Office of Financial Aid Advisors to ensure compliance with federal aid, including loans and state and university guidelines.
2. The Program DGS or Program Administrator for program-specific funding questions.
3. The LGS Student Funding team for all LGS funding sources routed through the schools and a student's graduate program.
4. Students who secure external grants may also engage with the Emory Research administration. The following article provides an overview of multiple funding sources.

# Section 1: Graduate Cost of Attendance

LGS draws on a combination of funding resources to pursue their graduate degree. Students enrolled full-time in LGS doctoral programs are eligible for full or partial tuition scholarships. In addition, full-time doctoral students may receive stipends from the university or external sources. The support available for master's students is more limited and varies by program. Some master's programs offer partial tuition scholarships, often on a merit basis. It is best to contact the program to discuss the cost of attendance.

The cost of attendance is an estimate of the total amount it will cost a student to go to school for an academic period, and it is determined using rules established by law. The cost of attending Emory University includes tuition and student fees, living expenses, health insurance, parking fees, and incidentals, such as purchasing textbooks, computers, and supplies. The Board of Trustees determines all tuition and fees, which are subject to change without notice. Information about tuition and fees can be found on the Tuition and Costs page of the LGS website.

# Section 1.1: Graduate Cost of Attendance: Transcript Fee

All new degree and certificate students must pay a one-time transcript fee of $70 when they first enroll at Emory. This fee is a one-time fee that pays for all future transcripts. If you have previously obtained a degree from Emory, you may have paid this fee already. For more information, see the Registrar's website.

# Section 1.2: Graduate Cost of Attendance: Mandatory Health Insurance

All new and continuing degree-seeking Emory University students must have health insurance. Under this requirement, students must purchase the Emory University Student Health Insurance Plan (EUSHIP) or opt out by providing enrollment documentation in a comparable United States-based plan. In addition, new students wishing to waive enrollment in the EUSHIP must complete the annual waiver process.

If a student has yet to waive out of the EUSHIP by the date of Emory's pre-term Student Accounts and Billing bill, the student will be billed for the EUSHIP. For more information, visit the Student Health Services website.

# Section 1.3: Graduate Cost of Attendance: Financial Responsibility to the University

Students are responsible for maintaining good financial standing with the University, including timely tuition payment, emergency loans, and other fees and fines incurred by the libraries or parking office.


Penalties for past due accounts include cancellation of registration, refusal to approve continued registration, refusal to release transcripts, and withholding of diplomas.

For more information, visit the Student Accounts and Billing Office website.

# Section 1.4: Graduate Cost of Attendance: Courtesy Scholarships
The Courtesy Scholarship is a grant that covers tuition exclusively (not textbooks, fees, or other miscellaneous charges). It is made available to Emory employees and their family members who apply and are admitted for enrollment in academic programs at Emory University. The percentage of tuition covered depends on your years of service.

Emory employees must contact Human Resources for information about eligibility for Courtesy Scholarships. Courtesy Scholarships do not cover application fees and tuition for audited courses.

# Section 2: Merit Awards and Financial Aid

Official notification of merit awards comes from the LGS, although some programs advise students of their award recommendations. Additionally, all offers of financial assistance are made per the April 15 Resolution adopted by the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS). A copy of the April 15 resolution and a list of CGS member institutions supporting the resolution are available on the CGS website.

# Section 2.1: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Loans and Office of Financial Aid
For many Emory University students, loans are essential to pay for some of their educational costs. These funds must be repaid. For information on student loans, visit Graduate Student Loans.

Contact the Office of Financial Aid to speak with a financial aid advisor about the cost of attendance and federal and private loan program information.

# Section 2.2: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: LGS Awards: Tuition Scholarships
Tuition scholarships may cover partial or complete tuition. These scholarships are for tuition credits only. They are not cash and cannot be converted to another purpose or paid directly to students. Doctoral students who have been granted an extension in their seventh year and beyond may receive partial tuition scholarships.

# Section 2.2: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: LGS Awards: Doctoral Student Base Stipends
Doctoral student base stipends are disbursed monthly on the last business day of the month. Eligibility for stipend support expires when a student graduates, withdraws, is not enrolled or is inactive, is dismissed, or otherwise becomes ineligible. Doctoral student base stipends are disbursed over 12 months, from September - August.

# Section 2.3: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Electronic Stipend Deposit
All doctoral students receiving an LGS stipend must enroll in Direct Deposit to receive funds. Several days before funds are deposited into accounts, the University will send an email notification that the deposit is forthcoming. Funds will be deposited on the last business day of the month, not on the day the email notification is sent.


# Section 2.4: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Termination or Suspension of Stipend Support

Eligibility for student stipends ends when a student graduates, withdraws, is not enrolled, is dismissed, or becomes ineligible. Unused stipends cannot be deferred or reserved. In addition, stipend support for a student on an approved leave of absence (LOA) will be paused until the student returns from LOA.

# Section 2.5: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Conditions and Eligibility for LGS Funding

The Ph.D. stipend is intended to support graduate students so that they may devote themselves to full-time study in their programs. LGS also recognizes that various training opportunities align with students' graduate study programs and provide compensation in addition to the LGS base stipend support. Further, LGS recognizes that students may wish to work in an employment capacity unrelated to their program of study and that, in some cases, they can do so while remaining devoted to full-time study. A student who works in either type of employment capacity while in full-time student status may require approval to do so, and there may be consequences for the base stipend support LGS provides. The principles governing the approval of outside employment and the consequences for stipend support are grounded in Emory's Policy 10.5 on credit hours and standard practices around scholarship in a rigorous academic program.

# Section 2.5.1: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Approval of Outside Employment

Full-time status for LGS students requires enrollment in more than nine (9) credit hours per term, though students commonly enroll in twelve credit hours. Emory Policy 10.5 establishes guidelines for real-time devotion to study for a given number of credit hours. Under the 10.5 policy, a student enrolled in twelve credit hours is expected to devote at least 30 hours per week to learning, typically between classroom contact with faculty and outside-of-class learning.

A full-time LGS student who receives a stipend may work in an employment capacity for up to 10 hours per week without seeking permission from an advisor, program leader, or the LGS Dean's office. A full-time LGS student who receives a stipend must seek approval from their DGS and the LGS Dean's office when they wish to work in an employment capacity for more than 10 hours per week. Graduate students who identify training opportunities aligned with their program of study should consider enrolling in GRAD 705R. For more information, please visit the LGS internship and experiential learning page.

# Section 2.5.2: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Outside Employment and Stipend Support

Students approved to work while maintaining full-time status will receive base stipend support according to the following schedule.

1. A student who is approved to work between 11 and 20 hours per week in outside employment will receive the total LGS base stipend rate for the period in which they are employed.
2. A student who is approved to work between 21 and 30 hours in outside employment will receive 50% of the base stipend support rate for the period in which they are employed.
3. A student approved to work 31 hours or more will not receive LGS base stipend support during their employment period.

# Section 2.6: Merit Awards and Financial Aid: Tax Liability

The tax treatment of scholarships, subsidies, fellowships, grants, awards, or stipends may vary for each student. Students should consult the IRS for information about taxes.


Emory University does not offer personal tax advice. Instead, Emory University recommends seeking professional tax counsel whenever necessary.

# Section 3: LGS Emergency Loan Fund

The purpose of the LGS Emergency Loan Fund is to help students through unexpected financial crises, such as illness, family job loss, and delays in other types of funding. The maximum loan amount is $1,000. A student who receives an emergency loan must sign a promissory note agreeing to repay the loan within 89 days of issue. Emergency loans are interest-free for 89 days.

# Section 3.1: LGS Emergency Loan Fund: Eligibility

A loan applicant must be a full-time student in a degree program and be enrolled for at least nine credit hours in the term they wish to receive the loan.

A Loan applicant must have no outstanding debt due to a previous loan from the LGS Emergency Loan Fund or the University.

A Loan applicant must demonstrate financial need of an emergency nature. Students in special standing are not eligible to receive emergency loans.

# Section 3.2: LGS Emergency Loan Fund: Procedure

Emergency Loan Fund application forms are available in the LGS office and on the LGS website. Applicants must complete the application form and turn it in to the LGS. In addition, the student is required to state on the application how the loan will be repaid.

New students are eligible to apply for emergency loans once the following conditions are met:

- The student is enrolled full-time in the current term; and
- The student's financial aid has been posted or is pending (students should consult their OPUS account for their financial aid status)

Finally, new students must have their DGS, PD, or program administrator sign the emergency loan application.

LGS must approve all loans. Requests are usually processed in one (1) day.

After the loan request is approved, the student must sign a promissory note and deliver it to the Student Accounts and Billing Office, 101 B. Jones Center. Usually, the student can pick up the loan check within 2-3 days of delivering the promissory note to the Student Accounts and Billing Office. Still, under some circumstances, the process may take longer.

Loans must be repaid in full within 89 days of issue. The loan amount and payment due date will be posted to the student's account when the loan is issued. When the emergency loan is due to be repaid, this amount will become a current charge and appear on the student's bill during the next billing cycle.

Past-due emergency loans are subject to interest charges. In addition, student borrowers who do not repay loans according to schedule shall be responsible for paying any costs associated with the loan collection, including attorneys' fees. Nonpayment can result in the student not being allowed to


register, receive a transcript, or graduate.

# Section 4: Financial Aid and Satisfactory Academic Progress

Federal regulations require that students receiving financial assistance maintain satisfactory academic progress. Therefore, the Office of Financial Aid must monitor a student aid recipient's academic progress. Aid recipients must meet specific quantitative and qualitative measures and complete their programs within a maximum time. All students who receive financial aid from federal, state, or Emory-funded sources must be enrolled degree candidates in good standing to retain financial aid awards. Academic records will be evaluated each term. Evaluation factors include:

- Grade point average (GPA),
- Time to degree completion, and
- Percentage of courses passed.

Students must also meet the following minimum grade requirements to meet satisfactory academic progress standards.

- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS, MSM): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.
- Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.): Must maintain a 2.7 current GPA each semester and an overall 2.7 cumulative GPA.

Any student who fails for two successive terms to pass two-thirds of the hours taken shall be automatically excluded regardless of any previous average.

All students are expected to complete their degree programs within a maximum time frame. The maximum time frame for graduate students is 150% of the hours required to complete their degree program. Time to degree completion is calculated for all credit hours for which the student enrolls or receives credit at Emory. The following grades are assigned: A, B, C, D, F, Satisfactory, and Unsatisfactory. A course assigned an Incomplete, in progress, or Withdrawal is counted toward attempted credits. Audited classes are not considered attempted credits.

- Master Programs (MA, MDP, MM, MS): Must complete the degree within 108 attempted units based on a 72-unit degree requirement. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.): Must meet the degree within 324 attempted units based on a 216-unit degree requirement.

# Section 4.1: Financial Aid and Satisfactory Academic Progress: Monitoring Eligibility: Disqualification, Probation

Students whose academic records fall below the minimum standards stated above or at the recommendation of their program may receive an academic warning, and a temporary hold may be placed on stipend and health insurance subsidy disbursement. The Program DGS must demonstrate that supportive corrective measures were attempted, including conversations with the LGS Student Affairs Dean. Students may appeal a recommendation of their program by following the procedures for an appeal outlined in their program handbook. The LGS Dean must approve any temporary holds or disqualification from receiving future stipend disbursement. Disqualified students may be approved to receive financial aid after successfully appealing their case, as outlined below. Students who successfully appeal are placed on probation. During the probationary period, students remain eligible for financial aid. Students on probation must receive a GPA of at least 2.7 and are not permitted to


receive grades of F, U, W, WF, WU, I, IF, or IU. Students who receive aid on probation and fail to meet probationary conditions will be ineligible for future stipend disbursement. Students who become ineligible for funding or fail to meet probationary terms can re-establish their eligibility by attending classes at their own expense or with the help of private resources outside the University. Once minimum standards are met, stipend funding may be reinstated.

An appeal for extenuating circumstances should be submitted by the first day of class for the term you are appealing to ensure adequate time to prepare for any impact to the student account. Failure to submit your complete appeal by this date may result in your probationary term being postponed to a future semester.

A Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form should be submitted with supporting documentation of mitigating circumstances that negatively impacted academic progression. Please contact your financial aid advisor if you have questions about your case.

The Office of Financial Aid will only approve one appeal per academic degree. However, this policy may be waived case-by-case where extenuating circumstances can be documented. For more information, including answers to some frequently asked questions, please refer to the Satisfactory Academic Progress page of the Office of Financial Aid's website.

# Article III: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance

Preamble

LGS grants rights to the students in its community that align with the LGS vision and mission. These rights include:

1. The right to academic freedom includes freedom of thought and expression per Emory's Respect for Open Expression Policy 8.14.
2. The right to be free from discrimination, bias, and harassment based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, ability status, genetic information, veteran status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law.
3. The right to fair and due process procedures in LGS Honor, Conduct, and Grievance cases.
4. The right to participate in academic and non-academic activities sponsored by the University within the constraints of applicable policies or requirements.

All students, faculty, and members of the Emory community are also expected to cooperate in maintaining academic and conduct integrity. Members of the Emory community should strive to excel in their academic pursuits in a just way with honesty and fairness in mind and avoid all instances of cheating, lying, plagiarizing, or engaging in other acts that violate these Honor and Conduct Codes.

LGS expects every student and member of our Emory community to know the policies provided and cited herein. Therefore, all students should revisit the Handbook and any linked policies as frequently as needed to familiarize themselves or check for updates to these policies.

# Section 1: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Academic Misconduct


Academic misconduct is an offense defined as offensive to the integrity and honesty of academic community members. A person commits academic misconduct when they intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly engage in prohibited actions. Prohibited actions include but are not limited to the following:

- cheating or obtaining unauthorized assistance in any academic assignment or examination
- acquiring, receiving, or passing on information about the content of an examination prior to its authorized release
- plagiarism, fabrication, or falsification of information
- attempting to do any of the previous

The LGS defines plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification consistently with the definitions provided in Emory University Policy 7.8. Every student must know the regulations regarding academic misconduct. Ignorance of the Honor Code is not a defense against an alleged violation.

# Section 2: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: The Use of Sources in Writing Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations

Because of the seriousness of plagiarism when conducting scholarly research, the LGS Executive Council has adopted the following statement on plagiarism. Each student is responsible for understanding this statement, conducting their research, and writing following the highest standards of integrity.

A writer's data, facts, ideas, and phraseology should be regarded as their property. Any person who uses a writer's data, facts, ideas, or phraseology without giving due credit is guilty of plagiarism. Information may be put into a research paper, thesis, or dissertation without a footnote or other documentation only if it meets all the following conditions:

1. It may be found in several books on the subject.
2. It is written entirely in the student's words.
3. It is not paraphrased from any source and is regarded as common knowledge.

Whenever any idea is taken from a specific work, even when the student writes it entirely in their own words, there must be a citation giving credit to the author responsible for it. Methods of citation vary. The student must provide appropriate credit.

The student is entirely responsible for knowing and following the principles of paraphrasing:

*In paraphrasing, you express another writer's ideas in your own words. A good paraphrase preserves the sense of the original but not the form. It does not retain the sentence patterns and merely substitutes synonyms for the actual words, nor does it retain the original words and merely alter the sentence patterns. It is a genuine restatement. Invariably it should be briefer than the source. (Floyd C. Watkins, William B. Dillingham, and Edward T. Martin, Practical English Handbook, 3rd ed., Boston, 1970, p. 245.)*

Any direct quotation must be documented. Even when a student uses only one unusual keyword from a passage, that word should be quoted. If a common brief phrase is used as it occurs in a source, the words should be in quotation marks. Any questions should be referred to the DGS or the PD in the student's program.

The LGS and the Undergraduate Academic Honor Code of Emory College Of Arts And Sciences, Goizueta Business School, And Oxford College concur that using an artificial intelligence program to generate any content for any assignment (including, but not limited to, examinations, papers, homework, and creative work) constitutes plagiarism and is a violation of the Honor Code unless students acknowledge in the assignment the extent to which an artificial intelligence program contributed to their work and outside resources are permitted for the assignment. Using an artificial intelligence program for an academic


assignment when external resources are not allowed or when the use of artificial intelligence programs is prohibited may also constitute seeking unauthorized assistance or violate other provisions of the Honor Code. Students should contact their DGS, Faculty Mentor, or instructor of records to inquire about the appropriate use of artificial intelligence programs if they need clarification about the expectations.

# Section 3: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Procedures for Reporting Cases

1. Any individual who suspects that an offense of academic misconduct has occurred shall report this alleged breach to the DGS, PD, or a member of the decanal staff of the LGS.

2. When a report comes to a DGS or PD, they should promptly notify the Dean of Student Affairs in the LGS in writing. In some cases, when research misconduct is involved, jurisdiction is shared with the Emory Office of Research Integrity and Compliance (ORIC). Emory Policy 7.8 outlines the policies and procedures incorporated into a collaborative process.

3. Once relevant materials are received, the Dean of Student Affairs or designee investigates.

# Section 4: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Investigation Procedures

1. An investigation includes an interview with the Dean of Student Affairs and the individual making the allegation and a separate interview with the accused student to review the allegations. The accused student will be asked to submit a written statement within seven (7) days following the interview. The written statement should include their account of the incident that led to the allegation. The accused student should also identify potential witnesses who can speak to the allegation and their desired resolution outcome.

2. After speaking with the accused student and the individual making the allegation, the Dean of Student Affairs or designee shall collect any additional information or interview other individuals who may have information related to the allegations. The Dean of Student Affairs then decides whether sufficient information supports moving forward to the student's desired resolution.

3. If sufficient evidence does not exist to move forward to a hearing at the Dean of Student Affairs discretion, the Dean of Student Affairs will notify the parties that there needs to be more information to move forward with the process.

# Section 5: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Honor Code Hearing Committee Paths for Resolution

# Section 5: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Informal Resolution

A student may accept responsibility and attend an informal resolution meeting instead of a full investigation and hearing. The reported student will meet with the Dean of Student Affairs and the Laney Graduate Student Council (LGSC) Vice President to discuss the circumstances of the violation and its impact on the student and the community. The reporting faculty or DGS may also participate in the meeting. The informal resolution meeting assists the student in reaffirming and recommitting to the values of the Honor Code and academic integrity, learning from the incident, and providing context to the Dean of Student Affairs and LGSC Vice President as they recommend sanctions to the Dean.

# Section 5: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Investigation and Full Hearing

The Dean of Student Affairs will convene a committee to advance to a hearing. The Dean of Student Affairs will notify the accused student of the charges and offer to meet with the accused student to review the Honor Code Hearing Procedures and the student's rights as outlined below. The Dean of Student Affairs will also confirm potential witnesses to speak at the hearing.


# Section 5: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: LGS Honor Code: Honor Code Full Committee Hearing

1. The Dean of Student Affairs will form a committee. The Committee shall consist of:
2. The LGSC Vice President, or the Vice President's designee, will act as Chair of the Committee.
3. A member of the LGSC, excluding the LGSC President and anyone from the accused student's program.
4. Two members of the LGS graduate faculty, at least one of whom is from the accused student's program division (sciences, social sciences, or humanities), but neither can be from the accused student's specific program.

# Section 6:Honor, Conduct, and Grievance:  Honor Code Hearing Procedures

1. The Committee reviews materials gathered during the investigation and the written statement submitted by the accused student. The Dean of Student Affairs will collect the information if the Committee requests additional materials. After reviewing the investigation materials and the list of proposed witnesses, the Committee will set a hearing date and include in the notice the individuals who may be asked to speak at the hearing.

2. Once a hearing date is scheduled, the Dean of Student Affairs will send the accused student a notice of hearing with the date, time, and place of the hearing—which may be conducted electronically at the Committee's discretion. The notice shall also include the names of the Committee members. The accused student will have three (3) days from receipt of the notice to raise any objection to the Committee members. Any objection should outline in sufficient detail a reasonable basis for the objection. The notice will also include the names of individuals who may be asked to speak at the hearing. Should an objection be filed, the Dean of Student Affairs will decide whether members of the Committee should be replaced.

3. If the accused student or a witness, after receiving the notice of hearing, cannot appear at the time and place specified for the hearing, they may submit a statement to be read during the hearing. Should the accused student not appear or be removed from the hearing, the Committee has the discretion to conduct the hearing with the student in absentia.

4. Hearings shall be fair and impartial. The hearing is an educational process, and the rules of evidence in a court of law shall not apply. It is within the Chair's discretion to exclude any irrelevant, duplicative, and prejudicial evidence.

5. Before testifying, the Committee shall remind each witness of the expectation of truthfulness, candor, and LGS expectations related to confidentiality (described further below).

6. The accused student and only members of the Committee may question witnesses.

7. Individuals are expected to ask and answer questions respectfully and non-argumentatively and refrain from engaging in abusive, aggressive, or disruptive behavior. If any individual, including an advisor, violates these standards of decorum, they may be removed from the hearing.

8. Other than the witness, while testifying, only the members of the Committee, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS designated by the Dean, and the accused student and their advisor may be present during the hearing.

9. The Dean of Student Affairs will record the hearing, except for the Committee's final deliberations. The recording is retained by LGS per the University's record retention schedule. No other recording is permitted to respect the confidentiality of the process and privacy rights applicable to educational records.

10. After the hearing, the Committee shall retire to deliberate in private. If the Committee determines that the accused student is responsible for the alleged violations, the Committee shall secure from the Dean the record of any previous disciplinary violations by the student. Based on its findings in the case and the student's prior disciplinary record, the Committee shall


notify the LGS Dean of its findings and a recommended sanction or sanctions (as stated below).
Recommended sanction(s) may or may not mirror previous disciplinary sanction(s).

11. A three-fourths vote of the Committee shall be required for a finding of an Honor Code
    violation, and the Committee shall vote on each sanction listed below. After the Committee's
    deliberation and vote, the Committee shall prepare a written summary that includes a recitation
    of pertinent evidence and facts, the finding of the Committee, and a recommended sanction(s)
    should the Committee find the accused student has committed an Honor Code violation. The
    Committee will submit the written summary only to the LGS Dean and Dean of Student Affairs.
    After receipt, the Dean shall review the summary and recommended sanction(s) and may listen
    to the hearing recording to determine if the Committee's recommendations are fair and
    impartial. The LGS Dean has the discretion to adopt the recommended sanction(s) or to increase
    or decrease its severity. Finally, the Dean will prepare a written statement of the outcome of the
    Committee's findings, the sanction(s) the Dean finds appropriate, and the student's right to
    appeal. The accused student and the University Registrar will receive a copy of the outcome
    notification. In addition, the program DGSs, and the faculty member directly involved with the
    allegation may also receive a copy of the notice.

# Section 7: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: Student's Rights

1. The accused student shall have the right to testify, be present at the hearing, and make an
   opening and closing statement.

2. If the accused student needs accommodation(s) during the hearing, the student must
   contact Emory's Department of Accessibility Services (DAS) and notify the Dean of Student
   Affairs as soon as possible. The Dean of Student Affairs and DAS will then engage in the
   interactive process to determine what accommodations are needed.

3. The accused student shall have the right to have an advisor at the hearing. The advisor shall be
   an LGS community member – student, faculty, or staff. In cases where the accused student
   claims that limiting the advisor pool to the LGS community poses a hardship, the Dean of
   Student Affairs, in their sole discretion, may allow the accused student to select any non-
   attorney from within the University community as an advisor. In all cases, the Dean of Student
   Affairs reserves the right to restrict the choice of adviser should the person chosen to serve in
   that role have a conflict of interest. The advisor's purpose is to support the student throughout
   the process and is limited to a non-speaking role. The advisor may not speak to the Committee
   or witnesses.

4. The accused student shall have the right to call a reasonable number of witnesses, present
   evidence, and question witnesses. The accused student must identify potential witnesses and
   evidence in their written statement during the investigation stage and will have an opportunity
   to identify witnesses whom they want to speak at the hearing. The Dean of Students will notify
   the witnesses if they need to be at the hearing.

# Section 7: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: Sanctions

When the Committee finds a student responsible for an Honor Code violation, one or more of the
following sanctions may be imposed. All sanctions will be recorded in the student's academic record.

1. A verbal warning.
2. An educational program.
3. Probation. Probation will signify that the student is not in good academic standing with the
   University during probation.


4. Partial or no credit on the examination, evaluation, or assignment.
5. Failure of the course.
6. Suspension from the program and or Emory for a specific period.
7. Revocation of financial support.
8. Permanent expulsion from Emory University.
9. Other. Sanctions not listed above may be appropriate.

# Section 8: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: Confidentiality

Because alleged academic dishonesty can seriously impact a student's professional career and relations, all proceedings of the Committee and reviews of the Appeal Committee shall be carried out with due regard for privacy. It shall be the responsibility of the Chairs of the Committee and the Appeal Committee to take reasonable steps to ensure this privacy is maintained. Discretion is an essential step in our process for preserving the student's confidentiality and avoiding any action that could be perceived as retaliatory.

# Section 9: Honor, Conduct, and Grievance: Appeal Procedure

The decision of the Committee and the LGS Dean's decision on the sanctions shall be final unless the student provides the LGS Senior Associate Dean with a written appeal within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the decision. A student may only appeal on the following grounds:

- Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
- New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility was made could affect the outcome of the matter; or
- Members of the Committee had a conflict of interest or bias for or against the accused student that affected the outcome of the matter. If the conflict involves a member of the Committee, the accused student raised the potential conflict before the hearing.

Mere dissatisfaction with the decision of the Committee or the Dean's sanction(s) is not grounds for appeal.

The Senior Associate Dean shall appoint an Appeal Committee upon receipt of the appeal. The Appeal Committee shall consist of:

- Two members of the Executive Council of the LGS appointed by the Dean, one of whom shall be appointed Chair of the Appeal Committee: and
- The LGSC President and one member of the LGSC, not from the student's program, are appointed by the LGSC President.
- No member who has served on the Hearing Committee, in that case, shall be appointed or was a participant in the proceedings before that Committee.

The Appeal Committee will review the appeal and may review the case records, including the hearing recording. The Appeal Committee will review the materials to determine a reasonable basis for changing the outcome. Finally, the Appeal Committee will issue a written determination of the appeal and the rationale for the result or may request that the LGS Dean take the following steps.

- Affirm the original finding and sanction.
- Affirm the original finding but issue a new sanction, which may be of greater or lesser severity.


• Remand the case to the Committee or a new Committee to correct a procedural or factual
  defect.
• Dismiss the case if a procedural or factual defect cannot be remedied by remand.

The Appeal Committee's determinations are final and not appealable; however, the outcome
of a remanded case may again be appealed. The Senior Associate Dean will provide the student, Dean of
Student Affairs, and LGS Dean with the decision of the Appeal Committee.

This Honor Code is effective August 2023 and supersedes all previous versions, which are hereby
superseded and repealed.

# Part II: LGS Conduct Code
Preamble
This Conduct Code is presented to accomplish the following objectives:
• To acquaint students with the rights and responsibilities of members of the Emory community;
  and
• To introduce policies that apply to them as members of the academic community at Emory
  University.

As members of the LGS and University community, all students are expected to commit to standards
of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility. Students assume individual responsibility for
their conduct and their violations of the requirements of the Student Conduct Code. Continuation as a
student is conditional upon compliance with these requirements. This Code does not purport to
catalog every action that would be considered unacceptable behavior and, thus, a violation of the
Conduct Code. Instead, it attempts to exemplify conduct that would almost certainly consider a
violation. Further, this Code describes in detail the operation of the conduct procedures within the
LGS. LGS school administration may act outside the protocols listed herein in order to take necessary,
protective action to ensure that members of the Emory community are not subject to imminent harm.

# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior
Students are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of
the Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct
that could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,
examples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.

1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;
   counterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to
   university officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with
   outside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member
   of the University community, or its visitors or guests.

2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function
   under the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory
   community at any location or online space.

3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a


room, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.

4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.

5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.

6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term "contact" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. "Harassing and intimidating" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.

7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance. Examples of harassment include but are not limited to:

   a. For the avoidance of doubt, the definition of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature from the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16834/?security=d3b7518a869d72e6d5 b0c965c987b3c9053079b3 shall apply to allegations of harassment by a student based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age,


disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law. Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.

b. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises. For the avoidance of doubt, allegations of harassment based on race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any other factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law are addressed under the University's Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment.

c. Sexual harassment and other Prohibited Conduct outlined in the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination:https://emory.ellucid.com/documents/view/16836/?security=4f94881ac0ddcbae11c4a4115a74ae7de40de24b LGS prohibits all conduct that violates the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy, and allegations of such behavior will be addressed under that policy.

8) Recording without Consent: Taking a photograph or making an image or audio or video recording, including "streaming" audio or video, of any member of the Emory community without that person's consent. Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.

10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.

11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.

12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.

Section 2: Interim Action


The University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community. In all such cases, the appropriate University authorities will review interim measures promptly, typically within five business days.

# Section 3: LGS Conduct Code: Procedures for Reporting Cases

1. Any individual who suspects that an offense of academic misconduct has occurred shall report this alleged breach to the DGS, PD, or a member of the decanal staff of the LGS.
2. When a report comes to a DGS or PD, they should promptly notify the Dean of Student Affairs in the LGS in writing.
3. Once relevant materials are received, the Dean of Student Affairs or designee investigates.

# Section 4: LGS Conduct Code: Investigation Procedures

1. An investigation includes an interview with the individual making the allegation and a separate interview with the accused student to review the allegations. The accused student will be asked to submit a written statement within seven (7) days following the interview. The written statement should include their account of the incident that led to the allegation. The accused student should also identify witnesses who can testify to the allegation.
2. After speaking with the accused student and the individual making the allegation, the Dean of Student Affairs or designee shall collect any additional information or interview other individuals who may have information related to the allegations. The Dean of Student Affairs then decides whether sufficient information supports moving forward to a hearing.
3. If sufficient evidence does not exist to move forward to a hearing at the Dean of Student Affairs discretion, the Dean of Student Affairs will notify the parties that there is insufficient information to move forward with the process.
4. The Dean of Student Affairs will convene a committee if sufficient evidence exists to proceed to a hearing. The Dean of Student Affairs will notify the accused student of the charges and offer to meet with the accused student to review the Conduct Code Hearing Procedures and the student's rights as outlined below. The Dean of Student Affairs will also confirm potential witnesses to speak at the hearing.

# Section 5: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct Code Committee

1. The Dean of Student Affairs will form a committee when there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a hearing. The Committee shall consist of:
   - The Vice President of the LGS Council (LGSC), or the Vice President's designee, will act as Chair of the Committee.
   - A member of the LGSC, excluding the President of LGSC and anyone from the accused student's program.
   - Two members of the LGS graduate faculty, at least one of whom is from the accused student's program division (sciences, social sciences, or humanities), but neither can


be from the accused student's specific program.

# Section 6: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct Code Hearing Procedures

1. The Committee reviews materials gathered during the investigation and the written statement submitted by the accused student. The Dean of Student Affairs will collect the information if the Committee requests additional materials. After reviewing the investigation materials and the list of proposed witnesses, the Committee will set a hearing date and include in the notice the individuals who may be asked to speak at the hearing.

2. Once a hearing date is scheduled, the Dean of Student Affairs will send the accused student a notice of hearing with the date, time, and place of the hearing—which may be conducted electronically at the Committee's discretion. The notice shall also include the names of the Committee members. The accused student will have three (3) days from receipt of the notice to raise any objection to the Committee members. Any objection should outline in sufficient detail a reasonable basis for the objection. The notice will also include the names of individuals who may be asked to speak at the hearing. Should an objection be filed, the Dean of Student Affairs will decide whether members of the Committee should be replaced.

3. Should the accused student or a witness, after receiving the notice of hearing, be unable to appear at the time and place specified for the hearing, they may submit a statement to be read during the hearing. Should the accused student not appear or be removed from the hearing, the Committee has the discretion to conduct the hearing with the student in absentia.

4. Hearings shall be fair and impartial. The hearing is an educational process, and the rules of evidence in a court of law shall not apply. It is within the Chair's discretion to exclude any irrelevant, duplicative, and prejudicial evidence.

5. Before testifying, the Committee shall remind each witness of the expectation of truthfulness, candor, and LGS expectations related to confidentiality (described further below).

6. The accused student and only members of the Committee may question witnesses.

7. Individuals are expected to ask and answer questions respectfully and non-argumentatively and refrain from engaging in abusive, aggressive, or disruptive behavior. If any individual, including an advisor, violates these standards of decorum, they may be removed from the hearing.

8. Other than the witness, while testifying, only the members of the Committee, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS designated by the Dean, and the accused student and their advisor may be present during the hearing.

9. The Dean of Student Affairs will record the hearing, except for the Committee's final deliberations. The recording is retained by LGS per the University's record retention schedule. No other recording is permitted to respect the confidentiality of the process and privacy rights applicable to educational records.

10. After the hearing, the Committee shall retire to deliberate in private. If the Committee determines that the accused student is responsible for the alleged violations, the Committee shall secure from the Dean the record of any previous disciplinary violations by the student. Based on its findings in the case and the student's prior disciplinary record, the Committee shall notify the LGS Dean of its findings and a recommended sanction or sanctions (as stated below). Recommended sanction(s) may or may not mirror previous disciplinary sanction(s).

11. A three-fourths vote of the Committee shall be required for a finding of a Conduct Code violation, and the Committee shall vote on each possible sanction listed below. After the Committee's deliberation and vote, the Committee shall prepare a written summary that includes a recitation of pertinent evidence and facts, the finding of the Committee, and a recommended sanction(s) should the Committee find the accused student has committed a


Conduct Code violation. The Committee will submit the written summary only to the LGS Dean and Dean of Student Affairs. After receipt, the Dean shall review the summary and recommended sanction(s) and may listen to the hearing recording to determine if the Committee's recommendations are fair and impartial. The LGS Dean has the discretion to adopt the recommended sanction(s) or to increase or decrease its severity. Finally, the Dean will prepare a written statement of the outcome of the Committee's findings, the sanction(s) the Dean finds appropriate, and the student's right to appeal. The accused student and the University Registrar will receive a copy of the outcome notification. In addition, the program DGSs, and the faculty member directly involved with the allegation may also receive a copy of the notice.

# Section 7: LGS Conduct Code: Student's Rights

1. The accused student shall have the right to testify, be present at the hearing, and make an opening and closing statement.

2. If the accused student needs an accommodation(s) during the hearing, the student must contact Emory's Department of Accessibility Services (DAS) and notify the Dean of Student Affairs as soon as possible. The Dean of Student Affairs and DAS will then engage in the interactive process to determine what accommodations are needed.

3. The accused student shall have the right to have an advisor at the hearing. The advisor shall be a LGS community member – student, faculty, or staff. In cases where the accused student claims that limiting the advisor pool to the LGS community poses a hardship, the Dean of Student Affairs, in their sole discretion, may allow the accused student to select any non-attorney from within the University community as an advisor. In all cases, the Dean of Student Affairs reserves the right to restrict the choice of adviser should the person chosen to serve in that role have a conflict of interest. The advisor's purpose is to support the student throughout the process and is limited to a non-speaking role. The advisor may not speak to the Committee or witnesses.

4. The accused student shall have the right to call a reasonable number of witnesses, present evidence, and question witnesses. The accused student must identify potential witnesses and evidence in their written statement during the investigation stage and will have an opportunity to identify witnesses whom they want to speak at the hearing. The Dean of Students will notify the witnesses should they need to attend the hearing.

# Section 8: LGS Conduct Code: Sanctions

When the Committee finds a student responsible for a Conduct Code violation, one or more of the following sanctions may be imposed. The LGS Dean has the discretion to adopt the recommended sanction(s) or to increase or decrease its severity. The Dean will prepare a written statement of the outcome of the Committee's findings, the sanction(s) the Dean finds appropriate, and the student's right to appeal. The accused student and the University Registrar will receive a copy of the outcome notification and record in the student's academic record.

1. No sanction, case dismissed.
2. A warning.
3. An educational program. This could include a JPE course or seminar, CITI training or retake, or other training internal or external to Emory.
4. Probation. Probation will signify that the student is not in good standing with the University during probation.
5. Partial or no credit on the examination, evaluation, or assignment.


6. Failure of the course.
7. Suspension from the program and or Emory for a specific period of time.
8. Revocation of financial support.
9. Permanent expulsion from Emory University.
10. Other. Sanctions not listed above may be appropriate.

# Section 9: LGS Conduct Code: Confidentiality

Because alleged acts of misconduct can seriously impact a student's professional career and relations, all proceedings of the Committee and reviews of the Appeal Committee shall be carried out with due regard for privacy. It shall be the responsibility of the LGS Dean, chair of the Committee and the Appeal Committee to take reasonable steps to ensure this privacy is maintained. Discretion is an essential step in our process for preserving the student's confidentiality and avoiding any action that could be perceived as retaliatory.

The outcome of any actions taken directly associated with the accused student (s) of the complaint is part of the education record of the responding student. It is protected from release under the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). As allowed by FERPA, when a student is accused of a policy violation that would constitute a "crime of violence", the University will inform the alleged victim/party bringing the complaint in writing of the final results of a hearing regardless of whether the University concludes that a violation was committed. Such release of information may only include the alleged student's/responding student's name, the violation committed, and the sanctions assigned (if applicable). In cases where the University determines through the student conduct process that a student violated a policy that would constitute a "crime of violence", the University may also release the above information publicly and/or to any third party. FERPA defines "crimes of violence" to include: arson, assault offenses, burglary, criminal homicide (manslaughter by negligence), criminal homicide (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter), destruction/damage/vandalism of property, kidnapping/abduction, robbery, forcible sex offenses, statutory rape, and incest.

# Section 10: LGS Conduct Code: Appeal Procedure

The decision of the Committee and the LGS Dean's decision on the sanctions shall be final unless the student provides the LGS Senior Associate Dean with a written appeal within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the decision. A student may only appeal on the following grounds:

- Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
- New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility was made could affect the outcome of the matter; or
- Members of the Committee had a conflict of interest or bias for or against the accused student that affected the outcome of the matter. If the conflict involves a member of the Committee, the accused student raised the potential conflict before the hearing.

Mere dissatisfaction with the decision of the Committee or the Dean's sanction(s) is not grounds for appeal.

The Senior Associate Dean shall appoint an Appeal Committee upon receipt of the appeal. The Appeal Committee shall consist of:
- Two members of the Executive Council of the LGS appointed by the Dean, one of whom shall be


appointed Chair of the Appeal Committee: and
- The LGSC President and one member of the LGSC, not from the student's program, are appointed by the LGSC President.
- No member who has served on the Hearing Committee, in that case, shall be appointed or was a participant in the proceedings before that Committee.

The Appeal Committee will review the appeal and may review the case records, including the hearing recording. The Appeal Committee will review the materials to determine a reasonable basis for changing the outcome. The Appeal Committee will issue a written determination of the appeal and the rationale for the result. It may issue one of the following decisions.

- Affirm the original finding and sanction.
- Affirm the original finding but issue a new sanction, which may be of greater or lesser severity.
- Remand the case to the Committee or a new Committee to correct a procedural or factual defect.
- Dismiss the case if a procedural or factual defect cannot be remedied by remand.

The Appeal Committee's determinations are final and not appealable; however, the outcome of a remanded case may again be appealed. The Senior Associate Dean will provide the student, Dean of Student Affairs, and LGS Dean with the decision of the Appeal Committee.

This Conduct Code is effective August 2023 and supersedes all previous versions, which are hereby superseded and repealed.

# Part III: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure
Preamble
Emory University considers the safety and welfare of its students, faculty, and staff a top priority. Therefore, when a student engages in behavior that could constitute a violation of Emory's rules of conduct, the behavior will be addressed as a disciplinary matter under the applicable Student Conduct Code or, as appropriate, Honor Code, which defines prohibited conduct and outlines a process for conducting disciplinary proceedings.

This Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure is not a disciplinary code, policy, or process. It is not intended to apply to situations in which a student engages in behavior that could violate the University's rules of conduct (e.g., an Honor Code or Conduct Code). It is intended to apply when a student's observed behavior, actions, or statements indicate a direct threat to the student's health, safety or an immediate threat to the health or safety of others. There may be situations where this Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and the Student Conduct Code may apply. In all cases, the Dean of the LGS shall have final authority regarding the decision, enactment, enforcement, and management of the involuntary withdrawal of a student.

# Section 1: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Conditions
A student may be withdrawn involuntarily from Emory if the University determines that the student represents a direct threat to the health and safety of themselves or others by:
1. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that poses a high probability of substantial harm to themselves or others; or


2. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior that would cause significant property damage would directly and substantially impede the lawful activities of others or interfere with the educational process and the orderly operation of the University.

# Section 2: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Procedure

When the Dean or their designee, based on a student's conduct, actions, or statements, has reasonable cause to believe that the student meets one or more of the criteria for involuntary withdrawal, the Dean may initiate an assessment of the student's ability to participate in the University's program safely.

An Assistant or Associate Dean initiates this assessment by first meeting with the student to:

- Review available information concerning the behavior and/or incidents that have caused concern.
- Provide the student with a copy of this Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure and discuss its contents with the student.
- Provide the student an opportunity to explain their behavior; and
- Discuss options available to the student, including counseling, voluntary withdrawal, and evaluation for involuntary withdrawal.

If the student agrees to withdraw voluntarily from the University and waives any right to any further procedures available under this policy, the student will be given a grade of W for all courses, will be advised in writing of any conditions necessary before re-enrollment, and will be referred for appropriate services.

If the student refuses to withdraw voluntarily from the University, and the Assistant or Associate Dean continues to have reasonable cause to believe the student meets one or more of the criteria for involuntary withdrawal, the Assistant or Associate Dean may require the student to be evaluated by an appropriate mental health or other professionals.

# Section 3: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Evaluation

The Assistant or Associate Dean may refer the student for a mandatory evaluation by an appropriate mental health professional. The University may select a mental health professional so long as there is no cost to the student for the evaluation. A written copy of the involuntary referral shall be provided to the student.

The evaluation must be completed within five (5) school days after the referral letter is provided to the student. Before the evaluation, the student must sign a written authorization to exchange relevant information between the mental health professional(s) and the University. Upon completion, copies of the evaluation report will be provided to the Assistant or Associate Dean and the student.

The identified professional making the evaluation shall make an individualized and objective assessment of the student's ability to safely participate in Emory's program based on a reasonable professional judgment relying on the most current medical knowledge and/or the best available objective evidence. This assessment shall include a determination of the nature, duration, and severity of the risk posed by the student to the health or safety of themself or others, the probability that the


potentially threatening injury will occur, and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will sufficiently mitigate the risk. With appropriate authorization, the professional will share their recommendation with the Assistant or Associate Dean, who will consider this recommendation in determining whether the student should be involuntarily withdrawn from Emory. A copy of the professional's recommendation will be provided to the student unless, in the opinion of a mental health professional, it would be damaging to the student.

If the evaluation results in a determination by the mental health professional that the student's continued attendance presents no significant risk to the health or safety of the student or others and no considerable threat to the property, to the lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University, no further action shall be taken to withdraw the student from the University.

If the evaluation results in a determination that the continued attendance of the student presents a significant risk to the health or safety of the student or others, such that there is a high probability of substantial harm or a significant threat to the property, the lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University, the student may be involuntarily withdrawn from the University. In such an event, the student shall be informed in writing by the Assistant or Associate Dean of the involuntary withdrawal of the student's right to an informal hearing, their right to appeal the hearing officer's decision, and any conditions necessary for re-enrollment. In most cases, a student who is involuntarily withdrawn will be given a grade of W in all courses in which the student is currently enrolled.

# Section 4: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Informal Hearing

A student who has been involuntarily withdrawn may request an informal hearing before a member of the Laney Executive Council appointed by the Senior Associate Dean by submitting a written request to be heard within two (2) business days from receipt of the notice of involuntary withdrawal. A hearing will be set as soon as reasonably possible. The student shall remain involuntarily withdrawn pending completion of the hearing.

The hearing shall be informal and non-adversarial. During the hearing, the student may present relevant information and be advised by an Emory faculty, staff member, or licensed health professional. However, the advisor's role is limited to advising the student. After the hearing, the hearing officer shall decide whether to uphold the involuntary withdrawal or reconsider. The student shall receive written notice of the hearing officer's decision immediately.

# Section 5: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Appeal to the Dean

The student may appeal the hearing officer's decision to the Dean, who shall review all information presented and decide whether to uphold the involuntary withdrawal.

# Section 6: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Emergency Suspension

The University may take emergency action to suspend a student pending a final decision on whether the student will be involuntarily withdrawn in situations in which:
- There is imminent danger of serious physical harm to the student or others;
- There is imminent danger of significant property damage;


• The student is unable or unwilling to meet with the Assistant or Associate Dean;
• The student refuses or has failed to complete the mandatory evaluation; or
• The Emory Threat Assessment team and Assistant and Associate Deans determine such other exceptional circumstances that suspension is warranted on an emergency basis.

If action is taken to suspend the student on an emergency basis, the student shall be given notice of the emergency suspension and an initial opportunity to address the circumstances on which the emergency suspension is based.

# Section 7: Involuntary Withdrawal Policy and Procedure: Conditions for Readmission

Because this Involuntary Withdrawal Policy applies to cases in which there is a concern about the safety of the student or others, the Dean or their designee may require a student who has been involuntarily withdrawn under this policy to be re-evaluated before they are readmitted to ensure that they do not present a direct threat to themselves or others.

# Part IV: LGS Grievance Procedure

Students who wish to outline grievances or disagreements of an intra-program nature (e.g., grade dispute) should first address those concerns to either the PD or the appropriately designated Committee in their program. Students who do not reach a resolution through those avenues or believe that their issues cannot be reasonably resolved by going through those routes may bring their grievances to the LGS Committee on Grievances. The Committee on Grievances comprises three graduate faculty members appointed by the LGS Senior Associate Dean.

# Section 1: LGS Grievance Procedure: Filing a Grievance

To file a formal grievance, a student shall submit a written grievance to the Committee on Grievances by emailing the grievance to the Senior Associate Dean. The Senior Associate Dean shall then confirm receipt of the grievance and send it to the Committee on Grievances.

The grievance shall be no longer than five (5) single-spaced pages and should include the following:
• A concise statement of the grievance. This statement should indicate ways in which the program, LGS, and/or Emory University policy has been violated to the detriment of the student;
• A description of previous efforts sought to resolve the problem;
• A clear statement of the remedy sought; and,
• Supporting evidence for claims made in the complaint.

Any grievance filed to challenge a decision of the LGS Dean to dismiss a student from LGS must be filed within 15 days of receipt of the dismissal notice.

# Section 2: LGS Grievance Procedure: Committee on Grievance Procedure

Upon receipt of the grievance, the Committee on Grievances may request additional information from or about the student and may request statements from other parties. The Committee on Grievances may also request to meet with the student or other parties involved to clarify statements made in the grievance, comments made in other written communication with the Committee, or any other source of


uncertainty about evidence in the Committee's possession. During this process, parties may only be accompanied by a representative when invited to do so by the Committee on Grievances.

Based on the grievance and any other information gathered by the Committee on Grievances, the Committee on Grievances will make a written recommendation to the LGS Dean that will explain its reasoning and include all supporting documentation relevant to its recommendation. The LGS Dean will then ultimately decide the resolution of the grievance and will inform the student and the Committee on Grievances of the decision.

# Section 3: LGS Grievance Procedure: Appeals

Students can appeal the Dean's decision to the LGS Executive Council. The Chair of the LGS Executive Council will preside. Students must inform the Senior Associate Dean of the LGS that they intend to appeal within seven (7) days of the Dean's decision regarding the grievance. The Senior Associate Dean will provide a student who intends to appeal with the record developed by the Committee on Grievances. A formal appeal must be made in writing to the Senior Associate Dean within seven (7) days of receiving the record.

Mere dissatisfaction with the decision of the Dean is not grounds for appeal. A student may only appeal on the following grounds:

- Procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter;
- New evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the grievance was resolved which could have affected the outcome; and
- Members of the Committee on Grievances had a conflict of interest or demonstrated bias for or against the accused student that affected the outcome of the matter.

The Executive Council will review the appeal and may review all records in the case to determine if there is a reasonable basis for changing the outcome. The Executive Council will issue a written determination of the appeal and provide a rationale for its decision. The Executive Council may reach one of the following decisions.

- Dismiss the appeal for (1) failure to state a procedural irregularity, (2) failure to present new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the grievance was resolved, which could have affected the outcome, or (3) failure to state a conflict of interest or a demonstrated bias against the student on the part of a member of the Committee on Grievances.
- Affirm the Dean's decision.
- Overturn the Dean's decision and issue a new decision. The Executive Council may come to a new finding about the validity of the grievance. It may also issue a new remedy if necessary.
- Remand the case back to the Committee on Grievances or to a new Committee on Grievances to correct a procedural or factual defect.

The Executive Council's determinations are final and not appealable; however, the outcome of a remanded case may again be appealed.

The Senior Associate Dean shall promptly notify the student and LGS Dean in writing of the Executive Council's decision.

Use of the LGS grievance procedure will not prejudice in any way a student's rights under Emory University Policy 10.12, which pertains to Student Complaints, and provides that "[s]students should


first attempt to resolve their complaints with the office most directly responsible for the action being challenged."

# Part V: Commonly Used University Policies

LGS expects every student and member of our Emory community to know the policies provided or cited in this Handbook. Therefore, all students should revisit the Handbook and any linked policies as frequently as needed to familiarize themselves or check for updates to these policies. While some policies are linked below for ease of use, students are responsible for compliance with all LGS and Emory University policies, which are located in a central policy library at the following web address: https://policies.emory.edu/.

# Commonly Used University Policies: Emory Email Communication Policy
Email is the primary medium for official communication with students at Emory University. The University assigns each registered student an official Emory email address. All University communications sent via email will be sent to this address. Students are expected to maintain their accounts and check their email regularly so that new mail will be appropriately received and read. Certain communications may be time critical.

# Commonly Used University Policies: Student Technology Recommendations
Emory requires all students to own or have access to a computer that meets minimum hardware and software requirements as required by their School and degree program and works on the Emory network.

Starting with a computer that meets these minimum requirements will enable students to have a functional computer while pursuing their graduate degree. Emory Academic Technology Services recommends minimum computer specifications to avoid technical issues while accessing and submitting online course materials and collaborating in Canvas and Zoom. Additional Considerations should be made if you are enrolled in a class/program requiring Data Analysis and the use of large data sets. Visit Student Technology Support, the IT help desk, for additional support.

# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace
The relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:
1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,
2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,


3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and
4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.

When a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Students should consult the US Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Research Integrity and the Council of Graduate Schools' Project for Scholarly Integrity for additional information and resources.

The Code establishes standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility that all students are expected to follow. It's important to note that while the Code doesn't list every possible unacceptable behavior, it provides examples of conduct that would clearly violate the Code. Compliance with these requirements is a condition for continuing as a student, and the LGS administration maintains the right to take protective actions outside of listed protocols if necessary to prevent imminent harm to community members.",

The list is not exhaustive but covers major violations that could result in disciplinary action.",
        "pos": "# Section 1: LGS Conduct Code: Conduct on Campus and Standards of Behavior\nStudents are expected to conduct themselves honestly, civilly, and respectfully while members of\nthe Emory community. It is neither possible nor necessary to set forth every instance of misconduct\nthat could result in disciplinary action against a student. While the following list is not exhaustive,\nexamples of conduct offenses are outlined in items I-XII below.  \n1) Dishonesty or Theft: Knowingly furnishing false information to the University or its agents;\ncounterfeiting, forging, or altering any University document; making a false statement to\nuniversity officials; misrepresenting one's status in the University in communication with\noutside parties; theft of any property of the University itself, or any property of any member\nof the University community, or its visitors or guests.  \n2) Personal Abuse: Physical, oral, or written abuse by a LGS student of any person at a function\nunder the University's supervision or sponsorship or such abuse of a member of the Emory\ncommunity at any location or online space.  \n3) Improper or Unauthorized Use of University Facilities: The refusal by a student to vacate a  \nroom, classroom, office, laboratory, or facility of the University when it is not open or not available for the use of students generally or the student or groups of students. Malicious damage by a student to the property of another member of the University community (student, faculty, or staff), the property of the University itself, or the property of any visitor or guest of the University. Breaking into a locked room, office, or facility of the University or entering a room, office, or facility marked or understood as a prohibited or restricted area without authorization.  \n4) Disorderly Conduct/Disruption of Class or Research Space: Interference by a student by violence, force, disorder, obstruction, or vocal disruption of a university activity or activity authorized or sponsored by the University or by any school, program, division, or authorized student body, including disciplinary proceedings. Interference by a student with the instructor's right to conduct class as the instructor sees fit within the bounds of academic freedom and responsibility. If a person other than the instructor brings charges of interference with an instructor's rights as defined above, a member of the decanal staff of the LGS shall confer with the instructor, including regarding potential interference with the Respect for Open Expression Policy before any formal charges are brought.  \n5) Drugs and Alcohol: Emory University does not permit illicit drugs or the unauthorized use of drugs sometimes prescribed for medical purposes. Users, possessors, and/or providers of such drugs violate federal and state laws. Students who possess or use illicit drugs or furnish drugs to others are committing a severe conduct offense. Emory University does not permit drunkenness or furnishing alcoholic beverages to underage persons (under 21) or noticeably intoxicated persons. Policy 8.8 contains the full text of the Emory Alcohol and Drug Abuse Policy.  \n6) Stalking: Behavior where a person follows, is placed under surveillance, or contacts another person without the other person's consent. The term \"contact\" means to make or attempt to make any communication, including, but not limited to, communication in person, by telephone, by mail, by broadcast, by computer or computer network, or by any other electronic device. \"Harassing and intimidating\" refers to communication directed at a person that causes emotional distress because of a reasonable fear for the person's safety or the safety of others, which serves no legitimate purpose. It does not require an overt threat of death or bodily injury. To avoid doubt, allegations of stalking based on sex are addressed under the University's Sex and Gender-Based Harassment and Discrimination Policy 8.2.  \n7) Harassment: LGS prohibits harassment of any kind. Harassment can be conduct that persists after such behavior has been requested to stop. Harassment is any unwelcome oral, written, or physical conduct that is so severe and/or pervasive that it has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment or unreasonably interferes with or affects an individual's academic performance.

Allegations of discriminatory harassment of a non-sexual nature that relate to a student acting in their capacity as an employee are not resolved under the Conduct Code but rather under the policy applicable in that context.  \nb. Verbal abuse; epithets or slurs; negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts; denigrating jokes; insulting comments or gestures; and the display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group members. Students' calls, texts, emails, and social media usage can contribute to a hostile work, learning, or living environment, even if they occur away from the University premises.

Such as when a reasonable person would find the recording inappropriate and/or likely to cause injury or distress; if under circumstances where the person(s) has/have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n9) Refusal to comply: Refusal to comply with the directions of Emory officials acting in the proper performance of their duties.  \n10) Failure to uphold appropriate professional standards: Failure to uphold high standards of courtesy, integrity, and professional responsibility.  \n11) Failure to complete sanctions: Failing to meet sanctions imposed in a Conduct Code or Honor Code Process.  \n12) Other Conduct Offenses: Including other violations of law, Emory, or LGS policy, including, for example, but not limited to, violation of any health or safety rule, breach of acceptable use of technology or computing resources, or aiding and abetting others in the commission of Conduct Code violations.  \nSection 2: Interim Action  \nThe University reserves the right to take prompt, interim, necessary, and appropriate action to protect the safety and well-being of the campus community. The Vice President and Dean for Campus Life are charged with the welfare of all students. Accordingly, in appropriate situations, the Vice President and Dean for Campus Life or their designee have complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Likewise, the LGS Dean of Student Affairs has complete discretion and authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the situation and for its duration. Nothing in this policy limits the power of the University to take temporary administrative interim action to ensure the safety of the Emory community.

        "pos": "# Commonly Used University Policies: Policy on Consensual Teacher-Student Relationship: From the Faculty Handbook: Chapter 12 - Policies Regarding Conduct in the Workplace\nThe relationship between teacher and student is the foundation of the academic mission of the University. This relationship vests considerable trust in the teacher, who, in turn, bears the responsibility to serve as a mentor, educator, and evaluator. In discharging this responsibility, each teacher is accountable for behaving in a manner that reflects the highest levels of professional responsibility, recognizes the dignity and worth of each person at the University, and protects the integrity of the student-teacher relationship. Faculty-student relationships carry risks of conflict of interest, breach of trust, abuse of power, and breach of professional ethics. For these reasons, a teacher must not engage in any consensual sexual relationship(s) with a student while the teacher is in a position of academic supervisory authority with respect to the student. Nor may a teacher assert any supervisory or academic authority concerning a student who was the subject of a previous consensual sexual relationship. This prohibition extends to:\n1. consensual sexual relationships between a faculty member and any student or trainee,\n2. a graduate or professional student and an undergraduate student when the graduate or professional student has some supervisory, academic responsibility for the undergraduate,  \n3. to consensual sexual relationships between department chairs and students in that department, and\n4. consensual sexual relationships between graduate advisors, PDs, and all others (each of whom is considered a teacher) who have supervisory academic responsibility for a student and that student.  \nWhen a teacher-student consensual relationship exists, has previously existed, or develops, the teacher must decline to participate in any evaluative or supervisory academic activity concerning the student. The Provost, deans, department chairs, and other administrators should respond to reports of prohibited sexual relationships by inquiring further and, if such reports appear accurate, initiating appropriate disciplinary action or remedial measures against the teacher involved. Egregious breach of this policy is adequate cause for termination under Paragraph 12(c) of the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships.

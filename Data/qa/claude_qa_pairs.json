After completion, copies of the evaluation report are provided to both the Assistant/Associate Dean and the student."
    },
    {
        "query": "Under what circumstances can a student be involuntarily withdrawn from the University based on a mental health evaluation?",
        "answer": "A student can be involuntarily withdrawn if the evaluation determines that their continued attendance presents a significant risk to the health or safety of themselves or others, with a high probability of substantial harm, or poses a significant threat to property, lawful activities of others, or the educational processes and orderly operations of the University. In such cases, the student will be informed in writing of the withdrawal, their right to an informal hearing and appeal, and any conditions for re-enrollment. Usually, students who are involuntarily withdrawn receive W grades in all current courses."

    },
    {
        "query": "What are the key characteristics of the informal hearing process for involuntary withdrawal cases?",
        "answer": "The hearing is informal and non-adversarial. Students may present relevant information and can be advised by an Emory faculty member, staff member, or licensed health professional, though the advisor's role is limited to advising. The student remains involuntarily withdrawn until the hearing process is complete. After the hearing, the hearing officer decides whether to uphold or reconsider the withdrawal, and the student receives immediate written notice of the decision."

    },
    {
        "query": "Why might re-evaluation be required for students seeking readmission after involuntary withdrawal?",
        "answer": "Re-evaluation is required because the Involuntary Withdrawal Policy applies to cases involving safety concerns about the student or others, so the institution needs to ensure the safety risk has been addressed before readmission."
